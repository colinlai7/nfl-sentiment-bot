14,"&gt; And I don't think surgeons care about how students talk üòÇ they're all cocky too and they were that way when they were students too

Lol bro you have no clue. Have you listened to word I said? There‚Äôs no cockier group of humans on earth than Air Force fighter pilots by reputation yet that‚Äôs all part of the job that you see from the outside, but the inside is very different.

I see students like you all the time who think that just because they‚Äôre going into a cocky career field they should go and brag their ass off at every turn because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what pilots do‚Äù

No son. Surgeons (and pilots) are cocky IN THEIR ABILITIES, not in their leadership, not in their interactions with the public, etc.

This argument has gone way off the rails so I‚Äôm just gunna finish talking after this but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll want to get the last word in so you can feel victorious. So please feel free, i won‚Äôt be answering back

This is what I‚Äôll say though. If you want to be a good surgeon, a good professional, and a good public servant (because that‚Äôs your job, you ain‚Äôt dr. Strange) you need to be Humble. Credible. And Approachable. If you can hit at least 2 of the 3 you‚Äôll be successful. 

You‚Äôve hit zero so far.

Humble (don‚Äôt forget you‚Äôre the person who started dropping ‚Äúcredentials‚Äù with a random dude on the internet, pulling out statistics about how smart you are)

Credible (You‚Äôre a first year Med student. You haven‚Äôt accomplished anything and no one cares)

Approachable (you‚Äôre SUPER off putting from a professional standpoint. Clap back on the internet all you want but when you say someone has a ‚Äúdeadbeat job‚Äù because you‚Äôre an M1 then you aren‚Äôt approachable)  

I guarantee all those surgeons you aspire to be like aren‚Äôt actually the stupidly cocky Tads from Scrubs but are actually consummate professionals when it‚Äôs important.

You probably won‚Äôt agree with me, and you‚Äôll think I‚Äôm just ‚Äúdad-ing‚Äù  you but if you do manage to get through medical school and start operating on people then I hope you look at yourself in the mirror and stop acting like a fuckstick about your job because that‚Äôs the way you think you should act.",Raiders,1,1574031035,dxphwk

Bro I think you're taking things personally for some reason, you're welcome to look back at the thread but I've said one thing about you personally whereas you've spent the good part of two hours talking shit about me.

Also if we do some critical thinking and combine the low matriculation rates and high attrition rates, anybody who gets into school is much more likely than not smart enough to finish. So whether you're on your first day or your last day just being there means you're capable. And I don't think surgeons care about how students talk üòÇ they're all cocky too and they were that way when they were students too",Ravens,1,1574029984,dxphwk
19,"What school does that happen to be? Because you seem to be really quick to talk about the statistics and percentages of how ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù you‚Äôre claiming to be but you‚Äôve yet to actually say what school it is.

&gt; being surrounded by people who couldn't hack it doesn't make it greater

So the training I went through had high levels of both atrittion AND matriculation. My hands on the table so you can see exactly the percentages of applicants who get accepted every year and the number of people who wash out if you‚Äôd like on the internet. 

But honestly this isn‚Äôt about me at all, this is about you being an M1 and acting as if it‚Äôs some declaration of your intelligence. Which is not only cringe worthy but also a little sad. You‚Äôre not even a fucking M3 or M4. Your a baby ass student in your FIRST semester of medical school using it as credentials. 

If we had any students in UPT talking big game like you on the internet I‚Äôd shut that shit down ASAP. If I were a surgeon (or whatever the actual career you‚Äôre trying to become is) I‚Äôd be fuckin embarrassed by the way you‚Äôre talking.",Raiders,1,1574029381,dxphwk

Doritos Tacos can still lead a meal to the flavor bowl and provide longevity, but having a duel threat, pure taco eater is the new future. Taco Bell is not ready for someone who can outeat every DB in the league while also exhibiting taco awareness like Brees. Jackson is like having Vick's teeth at Atlanta and Vick's tongue at Philly. Vick was never the complete package at any point in his career. He had his lips when he was young and then developed his teeth later. Jackson is already there. We are watching the best eater in the league and it isn't even close. Sorry Mahomes and Brady. Jackson is the future of this sport and it is exactly why Vick turned the league on it's head when he had a good day. Jackson is Vick 2.0. Every top quality Vick had throughout his career, Jackson currently has and he is the complete package. And my God is it scary.

Time and injuries will tell, but we very well may be seeing the best eater of all time. Comparing Jackson to Brady's meat count, Mannings' presnap snacks, Brees' insane salsa, etc, and we are left with someone who has the highest upside potential I've ever seen out of a eater. Give Jackson 10 healthy years and he will change the sport forever. Vick nearly did, and every team thereafter was looking for the next scrambling duel threat eater. But none had the tastebuds of Vick....until Jackson. We are seeing the next evolution. People like McNabb and McNair, big cumbersome snackers, to people like Cam and Mahomes, cumbersome but tasty, and now we've moved to the end of the eating spectrum where Vick and Jackson sit. Jackson is already better than Vick ever was and that tells it all. The league has no answer for that level of eating and this sport was not built for it.

Give Jackson 10 healthy years and he will change the sport forever. Vick nearly did, and every team thereafter was looking for the next scrambling duel threat QB. But none had the athleticism of Vick....until Jackson. We are seeing the next evolution. People like McNabb and McNair, big cumbersome scramblers, to people like Cam and Mahomes, cumbersome but more athletic, and now we've moved to the end of the athletic spectrum where only Vick and Jackson sit.

Jackson is already better than Vick ever was and that says it all. The league has no answer for that level of athleticism and this sport was not built for it. Again, barring injury and Jackson will go down as the most talented QB of all time. Mark my words.",,4,1574017990,dxphwk

4191,Looking back on that PI the CB literally did every single rule infraction that any one of is called for PI. If you are not going to over turn that you have to take away the coaches challenge because how are they supposed to make a decision to challenge if they don't understand the rules? If the league is only going to over turn unfathomable PI then just have the booth call down and look at it.
