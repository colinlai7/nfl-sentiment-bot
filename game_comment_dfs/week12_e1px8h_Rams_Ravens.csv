169,"Russ's numbers weren't great even after padding them with OT. Not to take anything away from him in the game, that scramble in OT won the game for them. But remember niners were without Kittle (TE), Sanders (WR 1, after the 2nd quarter), the Gould (Kicker) and both of their tackles played like poop (both first game back after 5+ weeks off). With all that it took a missed niner OT FG (by off the street kicker), 8 dropped passes (see missing Kittle and Sanders) and the refs being unable to understand WTF seatle's back up qb was calling during the coin toss (he called heads, landed on tails, refs gave them the ball). That being said Kyler Murray looked great against us both times. So I have no doubt Jackson continue to look great against the niners. But niners D and O at this point &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rams.

I have a sneaking suspicion Bill played you guys a bit vanilla since he knew he was going to get a bye and see you again. I would not be shocked if they smoke you in the playoffs like the Chargers did last year (it only looked close in the last 1/6th of the games). 

Teams that'll match up the best against you are the Niners &amp; Saints. Despite the Niners being fairly beat up on both offense and defense injury-wise I thin they'll still take the Ravens down. 

All that being said, NEs offense does not look great, I'd give the Ravens a slight edge of making the SB.

Early games? Fumbles McGee. That's pretty much fixed.

49ers and ATL? Pick city. Last night he stopped forcing as many throws and actually used his feet to get yards when he had no options.

The fact he's been able to 1) forget about the last two games and play his heart out yesterday and 2) show real progression game to game says to me he's got a very real future as a starter for somebody, and that's awesome.

4079,"For games where a QB has thrown 5 touchdowns, Lamar Jackson would currently be in third place for least passing yards per touchdown.

1. Eddie LeBaron, 1962, 5 TD, 158 yards (31.6y/td)
2. Frank Tripucka, 1962, 5 TD, 168 yards (33.6y/td)

4. Boomer Esiason, 1989, 5 TD, 197 yards (39.4y/td)

Since #1 and #2 are in 1962, this makes Lamar Jackson (as of current stats in the game) #1 post-merger.

This could obviously change if he throws another touchdown. For 6 touchdowns, only 3 QBs have thrown 6 TDs and thrown under 250 yards:

1. Bob Griege, 1977, 6 TD, 207 yards (34.5y/td)

13409,You’re just scared of Lamar Jackson. They’re scared the league would be completely destroyed by him and his 2 foot dong. He would win every super bowl and never lose a game. So they keep him away from the spotlight and purposely lower his madden rating to make him look bad because they know what would happen if he was unleashed upon the whole league. He’d make Tom Brady look like Geno Smith. He’d make Aaron Rodgers look like a squirrel. He’d make Dak Prescott look like Dak Prescott. He would reign terror upon the whole league for decades upon decades. He would be dropping dimes on cornerbacks at age 70. It would never end. The league would die if they knew just how great Jackson is and everyone knows it. Goddell and Harbaugh keep him under wraps. Dave Gettleman saw Lamar during the senior bowl and instantly he knew how good he is. Only Harbaugh with his 0/20 vision can see how good this man is. Do not sleep on Lamar Jackson. He will fuck your mother. He will fuck your sister. He will fuck your girlfriend and your dad too. Your grandma? Just another night for Lamar. Be scared. Be very scared.,Seahawks,1,1574735798,e1px8h

There's definitely 2-3 solidly scripted opening offensive schemes with the intent of getting the early lead, then they seem to drop off where teams have (definitely not consistently) brought it close before getting gassed. WAY easier said than done, but I think the trick to beating this team is to make sense of those first scripted series and catch (somehow) an early lead on them. Then you make Lamar throw, which he can do, but not as well when he can't run too. That's probably all wrong but I love the strategy of this sport, so that's all I've got.

had a dream last night that felt like an alternative version of my past, one where i was cool and popular. i was back in jazz band, and we were traveling to compete in a competition. of course it was messed up as dreams are...the plane landed on some artic field next to the hotel, the sceneary was all weird and surreal as dreams are, but the gist of it was i was actually cool. i was flirting with this girl on the flight and it felt normal. in the hotel, i asked the teachers/chaperones where my room was, they ssaid 'oh, you're gonna be down here..."" in thisd big grand rtoom on the ground floor, near the adults. why wouldi get this deluxe room? because they were concerned about me going off in some girls room that night. such was my reputation...the kind of guy you'd think that would happen to.

it felt *soooo natural and normal for me, like thats who i was supposed to be, i read those glitch_in_the_matrix subs, i dont really believe them but i cant help but think, it does seem as if this timeline of my life was a busted one, i missed some 'step' i was supposed to hit.
