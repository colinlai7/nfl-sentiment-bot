0,"Lamar is being heaped with praise and in what world was Allens situation last year worse than Darnolds this year? By what objective metric? The only reason Baker is getting shit on is because 1) that team is too talented to be losing like they have and 2) he talks a lot of shit. 

You have no clue what you're talking about man, I'm glad you don't call the shots for the Jets. And plenty of people have been calling Sam a bust, in the media, and among fan bases. Plenty of people give all of these quarterbacks excuses, less so for Mayfield because of aforementioned reasons, and they all have plenty of detractors. What were you saying about Allen last year when he finished with a negative TD/INT ratio? You were probably making excuses about a shitty team and so on.",,1,1575309648,e4kgdn
1,"Because Darnold has been struggling this year and I personally think the Jets need to be considering moving on? That has nothing to do with who I’m a fan of.

It’s a fact that Darnold has been afforded all the excuses in the world that the other QBs haven’t been. Mayfield has a historically good rookie year and a terrible O-line this year? Nope, he’s a bust. Josh Allen has a worse situation last year than Darnold has this year? Nope, he’s already a bust. Don’t let me even get started on Lamar.",Bills,1,1575309134,e4kgdn
2,"Oline committed 10 penalties that negated any momentum we had, including a holding call that resulted in a safety. 6 different drops including one dropped TD, another throw where the WR pulls up early on what would've been a good chance for a TD, and a playcaller that thinks 3 screens in a row is going to catch someone sleeping. No one can overcome that. I don't think Darnold is playing top tier QB football, but I also think it's impossible to evaluate him on this team because they're impossibly inconsistent. In games where the protection holds for more than 2 seconds and the WRs hang on to passes he looks like one of the best QBs in football, in games like this he looks understandably pedestrian. He gets excuses because they're valid excuses, QB is the most important position, sure, but success at the QB position is not entirely independent of the success of the rest of the team. 

And yeah, you're bragging on the Bills because you're not used to seeing them be successful. Why the hell even come to this thread to shit talk another teams QB if not to make yourself feel better about your own?",,1,1575308700,e4kgdn
3,"Oh, what a tough guy here.

Funny you think me ragging on Darnold is me bragging about the Bills. It’s not.

Darnold isn’t performing up to expectations no matter how many excuses he gets. The QB is the most important position on the field. He could not score a touchdown against the worst team in football...but it has nothing to do with him. Okay then.

The one lying to themselves is you.",Bills,1,1575270098,e4kgdn
4,"You can lie to me, but you can't lie to yourself. Enjoy your year of supposed relevance. I remember back to back AFC Championship appearances with Mark Sanchez at the helm. I know when a good team is masking a mediocre QB.",,0,1575269795,e4kgdn
5,"Yeah, he probably would be better.",Bills,0,1575269636,e4kgdn
6,"Darnold is on easily the worst team with the worst coach out of all of them excluding Rosen. Do you really think Allen would be as/more successful given the same circumstances? Do you think Allen is winning you games, or is he just not losing them for you?",,1,1575268265,e4kgdn
7,"Darnold is the only one afforded this privilege compared to all other QBs drafted last year.

605,I'm not sure Dalton really has the arm to push that deep ball wide enough for that play.,Bengals,1,1575225027,e4kgdn
606,Darnold obviously still traumatized by shitty oline play. Hopefully he can start to play a little more relaxed but you can tell he's still scared. Rolls out of the pocket early and falls over as soon as a hand is on him. Hate to see it.,,1,1575224853,e4kgdn
