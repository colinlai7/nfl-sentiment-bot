I'm just salty about that bullshit call last year. Plus, Dak does intentionally slide late, and it's really frustrating. Defenses have a choice to either tackle and risk him sliding, or not tackling and risk him making a move for more yards. On the one hand, it's bs that refs call the late hits against him when he does that, but at the same.time, if the reffing is that bad and in his favor, I don't blame him.

No. There is no nfl rule that says ""dak did say defer before giving the rams the choice."" That's not a **rule** in the NFL rulebook.

The rule is that one team gets to say kick, receive, defend north, defend south, or defer. You can only pick one of those. If you pick kick, which Dak picked, then the other team gets to pick one of those four in the second half.

I didn't watch the coin toss, so I don't know what he actually said. Initially, they said Dak said ""kick,"" which means Rams get to choose to eceive second half. Then New York got involved and said that Dak didn't say that, and he said ""defer.""

2514,I love zeke and the Cowboys but no running back is worth that amount of money.  Running backs are getting easier to find and being used less effectively overall across the league in terms of a pure run game and the few really good backs that do get big contracts usually see their teams regret it. While zeke is still a top tier back him having a slightly down year from his first few + the success of Tony Pollard makes it even harder to justify his massive contract. And it gets even worse when you consider how many other young stars they're gonna be looking to sign. Like I said I'm a huge fan of zeke I just think overpaying running backs is lame. Also for all the talk of what a master negotiator Jerry is I thought it looked even worse that they gave him such a huge contract and made him the highest paid back by such a huge margin.,,1,1576450923,eb4jgo

both team’s captains (limit of six per team, active, inactive or honorary) shall toss a coin at the center of the field. Prior to the
Referee’s toss, the call of “heads” or “tails” must be made by the captain of the visiting team, or by the captain designated by the
Referee if there is no home team. Unless the winner of the toss defers his choice to the second half, he must choose one of two
privileges, and the loser is given the other. The two privileges are:
(a) The opportunity to receive the kickoff, or to kick off; or
(b) The choice of goal his team will defend.
If the coin does not turn over in the air or the toss is compromised in any way, the Referee shall toss it again. The captain’s
original call may not be changed.",Seahawks,8,1576446456,eb4jgo
