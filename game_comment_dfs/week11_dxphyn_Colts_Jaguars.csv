I don't think Marrone is a bad head coach (though I don't think he's a good one either), and he's definitely not in the Bradley tier. But Wash has to go.

Coughlin has to go if we don't re-sign Ngakoue. But after this past draft class, I'm fine keeping this front office.",Jaguars,1,1574044541,dxphyn

373,Foles is pretty terrible honestly. He is mistiming the easy throws and every time he launches deep it at best is an incompletion. I just don’t see how he even gives us a chance to win. We’re better off just giving the ball to Fournette 30 times.,Jaguars,6,1574021954,dxphyn

Then she proceeded to cry saying thing along the lines of waiting till marriage and etc etc. She kicked me out of her car and I walked home with the condom still on my thing. 

Anyways my dad was outside and i proceeded to go inside thru the garage. Later that night he found the condom on the garage floor and I blamed my brother.

The girl turned out to be a real freak afterwards and we dated for another year after. I miss her tho since she was later shot and killed after a night out a few years later. Her murder has turned cold. So every birthday I am reminded abt her.",Jaguars,8,1574015445,dxphyn
