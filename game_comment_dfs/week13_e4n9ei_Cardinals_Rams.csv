84,"I'd argue that right now, we have one glaring weakness and that's our OL. We could benefit from having better LBs, but this is the best crop we've had since the move back to LA.

Like I said, the 9ers have plenty of strengths, but maintaining a top D is harder than maintaining a top offense. The top D is always whichever team is able to present the fewest weaknesses so injuries and departing players hit harder year-to-year. Sherman aging a year could end up being a big enough weakness if he misses a step, and their offense is solid but not a world beater.

Seattle has a middling defense now and it could get both better or worse, and their OL still isn't stellar. They're very dependent on Wilson in a way that none of the other NFCW teams are on their QB.",Rams,2,1575243491,e4n9ei

-Your team had multiple chances to win after that
