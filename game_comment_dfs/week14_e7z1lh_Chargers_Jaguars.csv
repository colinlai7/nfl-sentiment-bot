24,"For those wondering and just blindly assuming this is proof Foles wasn't the problem;

94,"I honestly am thinking the 2017/2018 Eagles were a bit of a 'perfect storm' scenario where the coaches and players just fit each other perfectly. Foles was good in his few games on the Chiefs under Andy Reid too, the Eagles lost Foles, Reich, and DeFilippo, and now basically everyone is struggling out on their own.

Basically they are all pieces that fit together but when you take each individual out of that support system and toss them onto an island by themselves...not so good.

All that said, Foles gave you guys; a good drive, a couple average games, and one bad game. The rest of the team (defense, coaching) is still horrible though and they had no chance from the beginning. We were *all* fooled.",Eagles,1,1575847273,e7z1lh

102,"Yeah, all the commentary about him being washed up was silly. Getting knocked around every game takes its toll and he wasn't getting any protection.

Edit: And Foles this year gave you one good drive (injured), then 2 average games (average QB play was supposed to be enough for your guys defense to win, remember?), and one bad game. Minshew gave you a bunch of average (good for a rookie, though) games, and one terrible game. Meanwhile your defense has done nothing but poop the bed non-stop.
