Ever since I’ve been watching him hard and I’m just not convinced he’s as great as some are making him out to be.  I’m struggling today if the he was checking down at the end of this game or if niner playcalling was intentionally keeping the pressure off him.  They were literally calling trick plays on the go ahead drive before the game winning one, instead of just letting Jimmy G attempt to do it himself.

He played a great game looking at the stats, that bomb he threw was awesome.  There’s just feel he’s getting protected from something at this point.",,0,1575843067,e7wjeg

3495,"No, the receiver should not be penalized either. Im saying the rule shouldnt exist and the exact play that happened is okay and just shouldnt be a penalty.

The defender went low and the receiver dropped to his level. Defender was trying to wrap up because a form tackle involves dropping your hips and lunging at the ball carrier's waist. If the carrier drops their helmet while you lunge, there will be helmet contact and that isnt the defender's fault. This isn't complicated.",Bears,1,1575838847,e7wjeg

If they get a field goal the Saints still need a TD to win.  If the saints fail the two point conversion and hold them they can still get a field goal to tie.  But if the Saints convert the two they can still get a TD to tie the game.  Yeah?  Makes sense to me.,,2,1575838843,e7wjeg

On a fake punt there cannot be PI against a gunner; but defensive holding would still apply. I’ve looked at the rule
book a little bit and I don’t see anything that says defensive holding requires the ball not to be thrown.

It normally matters only because PI trumps defensive holding. So my understanding would be defensive holding could be called. 

Now I’d also like to point out that I don’t think that play should have been called a penalty, but I’d like to understand the actual rule.
