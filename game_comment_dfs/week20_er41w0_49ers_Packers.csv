557,"You’re drunk and emotional. There’s no reason Rodgers can’t be great again at his age if good players are put around him. 

This isn’t the 1970’s.  Players don’t turn into pumpkins at age 32 anymore.  He spent the season going through the growing pains of learning a new offense (the same one we saw tonight for the 49ers btw, in fine tuned fashion, rip the league up), except with a roster mostly filled with players that fit MM’s old scheme.  The 49ers are in year 3 of that rebuild. Give them some credit as an organization. 

Rodgers experience alone is a competitive asset. If they have a big time draft they’ll be good again (better actually, this year was mostly lucky).  If they don’t then they’ll regress to the mean (they might a little anyway as far as regular season goes). That’s all football is and has ever been. Don’t act like it’s some narrative fairytale. You’re as good as your 53 man roster/skill position players.

I rank Favre higher, he broke so many records by the time he retired and was great with a second team (Vikings) late into his career.  Not to mention his status as the greatest Ironman in NFL history. Also keep in mind Favre numbers would be far greater in today’s nfl.

He also had far greater intangibles (leadership, courage, toughness); if I was a player I’d much rather play w him than Aaron. Rodgers attitude just sucks.",Redskins,1,1579488170,er41w0

No team benefits more from friendly officiating than the Packers. I understand why you would categorize every other fan base as ""biased rivals"" to ignore what is so clear to everyone else.

Looking at the stats you cited doesn't help your argument. 5th fewest penalties for but 11th most in yards for. That means you're getting an abnormally hight number of high impact penalties. Top 3rd of the leagues in penalty yards for and middle 3rs for penalty yards against. Top 3rd in first downs awarded via penalty and lowest in the league for first downs awarded against.

No other team has such a favorable officiating outcome.

17673,"Proposing a new nickname for Aaron Rodgers - The Muskrat.

https://imgur.com/a/uO3hUIC

Why The Muskrat? For several reasons. 

1. There are muskrats in Wisconsin. Aaron Rodgers plays for the Green Bay Packers, who are located in Wisconsin.

2. Muskrats look like they have big bushy moustaches. As you can see in the comparison image above, Aaron Rodgers has a big bushy moustache.

3. Muskrats are omniverous. From what I have heard, Aaron Rodgers isn't a vegetarian, thus he is most likely an omnivore. 

4. California's Fish and Game Code allows for the trapping/destruction of Muskrats, since they are considered a nuisance. Aaron Rodgers is currently getting destroyed by a California team.

[Source - Section 4152] (https://www.animallaw.info/statute/ca-hunting-chapter-3-nongame-mammals-and-depredators#4152)

Raja, while waiting by his disabled car in [Palm Beach Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_Gardens,_Florida), [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-NYTimes-CJones-Details-2015-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-PBGPD-MediaStatement-NRajaIncident-2015-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-PBGPD-OfficerInvolved-Info-2015-4)

Raja, who was in plainclothes and in an unmarked white van, approached Jones, who was waiting by his disabled vehicle on a highway exit ramp.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-Freeman2019-5) Within seconds, Raja fired six shots at Jones, striking him three times.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-Rueb25Years-6) After the shooting, Raja falsely claimed to investigators that he had identified himself as a police officer and shot Jones in self-defense; both assertions were disproved by an audio recording of the fatal shooting.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-Freeman2019-5)

On June 1, 2016, Raja was charged with manslaughter by [culpable negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpable_negligence) and [attempted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder) first-degree murder with a firearm. He was convicted of the charges on March 7, 2019,[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-HauserGuilty-7) following an eight-day [jury trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-Freeman2019-5) Raja was sentenced to 25 years in prison on April 25, 2019.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Corey_Jones#cite_note-Rueb25Years-6)

Your run D showed the fuck up today. Could do the same against San Fran especially with Coleman likely out of the rotation who knows how it flows. Jimmy may have to beat ya.

On the flip side, that defense Is/was the nest in the league. That D line is one of the best positional groups in the league since the Legion of Boom (hate myself), can they put pressure on Mahomes? When the Titans were getting pressure early the game was close, so who knows if 49ers can maintain that all game or put on even more pressure.

With Hill though a big play can spring at anytime. Will always keep it interesting.

Y'all need help on the o line, a better blocking TE to throw in with Rudolf in 2 te schemes, and some help in the secondary. Your d line isn't terrible, but if you can draft either a pure rusher or pure run blocker, they will be super solid.

With all that in mind, Minnesota is 3 key players from contending with teams line the niners. If you find more, then you're way up there. The niners grabbed mostert from the bargain bin, got kittle in the fifth, got Tomlinson from lions for peanuts, got moseley undrafted to take over for solid cb in witherspoon.

I would even argue Winston has more talent (worse decision making), tannehill could be better, roethlisberger, Stafford, Newton (if he comes back), and even rivers.

It is extremely easy to argue that Jimmy G is not a top 12 QB and is only “good” because of his great defense, o-line, RBs/FB, and TE. You are a 49ers fan so obviously you will disagree and say he deserves to be in the top 10.",Seahawks,1,1579482969,er41w0

26810,"Well two of their touchdowns came off of PIs (one was legit one was a super weak call) and a blatant ignored hold in the 1st half. And then a really generous spot to seal the game.

Remember that post about what teams have had the most beneficial reffing of the decade? Packers.

To be clear the Seahawks didn't lose because of officiating, we shit away a whole half of football trying to force a nonexistent run game. Then we allowed 2 consecutive 3rd and long conversations and dropped a critical 1st down pass.

My point is this: no team statistically benefits more from officiating in the regular seasons (as measured by first downs awarded by penalty, fewest against on defense and most for on offense). In the post season refs hold their flags and games are officiated way tighter and the Packers typically shit the bed. I don't think those two things are just coincidence.",Seahawks,2,1579481625,er41w0

- Community College student was placing bombs at minority homes, murdered 1 and injured several others

- 60 something year old man injures over 90 people with a home made device to launch rocks from the bed of his truck over a 2.5 year period; after arrest it turns out he's gay guy that has a child sexual assault conviction on his history

- multiple LEO involved shootings, bank robbers etc

- tons of idiotic shit that goes down on 6th street

- IA investigation led to firing of detective because he was caught with prostitute and cocaine in a hotel room; he narcs on assistant chief and tells everyone he's a racist; black patrol officer sues the city for being denied advancement; major scandal going on

- Austin city council says homeless people can camp anywhere; homeless attacks increase dramatically including murders, arson, rape of business owner at 7am in her business, random stabbings, random vandalism of vehicles, etc

Do not do what Tom Thompson did and completely ignore the offense for years. Don't draft a WR in the 4th round or later every single year and expect the quarterback to make it work with this group of trash receivers, and do not draft defense in the first two rounds every single year.

Also, do not completely ignore FA like TT did. It allows you to improve your team, USE IT!!!

37298,"&gt; Fox’s The Masked Singer returned from its stint on the bench thanks to the World Series in fine fashion Wednesday, with its special two-hour block finishing as **primetime’s top-rated program**. Meanwhile, NBC’s Chicago trio were the the most-watched shows in each of their respective hours.

&gt; The results gave Fox the easy adults 18-49 demo win for the night in which all broadcast shows were in originals, NBC took total viewers.

&gt; The Masked Singer scored 2.0 ratings in both the 8 PM and 9 PM hours, with **6.97 million viewers** and **7.22 million viewers**, respectively. CBS’ Survivor (1.3, 6.80M) was second in the 8 PM hour ratingswise, jumping up two tenths from last week when Fox aired Game 7 of the World Series. Survivor‘s rating edged out Chicago Med (1.1, 8.03M), the night’s most-watched show, which like its Chicago brethren Wednesday fell a tenth week-over-week.
