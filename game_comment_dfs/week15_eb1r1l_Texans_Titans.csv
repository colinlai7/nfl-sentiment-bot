1,"Tannehill played a good game. That goal line pick was more of a fumble than an INT, he put the ball exactly wear it should have been. 

Our secondary was just too banged up to contend with Hopkins, Fuller, and Stills without much help from the pass rush. And our special teams just epically failed today.",Titans,1,1576472635,eb1r1l
2,Hopefully we get Adoree back at least,Titans,1,1576450826,eb1r1l
3,It was funny though. You can't deny it,Titans,1,1576450787,eb1r1l
4,Bro that fake punt call was terrible,Texans,2,1576447362,eb1r1l

8,+3.5 I’ll take it,Vikings,2,1576446164,eb1r1l
9,and the Titans haven’t made it past the divisional round since the Texans joined the league so I guess we’re about even in that time span.,Texans,2,1576445997,eb1r1l
10,I’m rich too. Everyone’s rich on the internet,Titans,1,1576445956,eb1r1l
11,Glad we agree,Texans,1,1576445707,eb1r1l
12,Nah,Texans,2,1576445693,eb1r1l
13,"Just clarifying with how you worded it. ""Spiking"" is an act at the end of a play after a successful snap of the ball. To say that you can't end a play with under 2 seconds is incorrect.",,1,1576445506,eb1r1l

19,We've successfully kept our team from leaving town at least.,Titans,0,1576444694,eb1r1l
20,Hyde has been a real good runner for us this year. Just hit 1000 yards with this game,Texans,1,1576444544,eb1r1l
21,Yeah but even if that was quicker the receivers wouldnt get back until there was a second left,Titans,1,1576444476,eb1r1l
22,Yes they do. The two losses vs Jacksonville and Indy early in the season are costing us big time.,Titans,2,1576444471,eb1r1l
23,"Yeah, not with our banged up secondary.",Titans,2,1576444402,eb1r1l
24,Neither of us have any championships so you could say we've had just as much success as the Texans in the playoffs.,Titans,1,1576444393,eb1r1l
25,"If Texans lose next week they’re 9-6, and if the Titans win they’re 9-6. If the Titans lose they’re 8-7 going into Week 17 and can tie; do Texans now own the tiebreaker in the event both are 9-7?",,1,1576444387,eb1r1l
26,"Ahhh. Good point. I guess I don't watch enough college ball to start making claims like that. Either way, its a cheap, but legal (and therefore smart) move.",49ers,1,1576444369,eb1r1l

31,That’s only on 1st downs,Texans,1,1576444264,eb1r1l
32,"People complain about the college method where the clock stops after the play, and only starts again once the ball is placed on the line of scrimmage, but it does prevent things like that",49ers,1,1576444245,eb1r1l

35,I'd love it but I can't see how our D will hold vs NO.,Titans,1,1576444188,eb1r1l
36,If you go back you can see him stand over the QB and make sure the ref came over to break it up so the clock will still run,Texans,1,1576444183,eb1r1l
37,Snapping the ball with under 2 seconds left results in that being the last play.  Does not matter when the ball is spiked.,,1,1576444165,eb1r1l

42,"Yeah, the Titans overcame on the next play, DESPITE officiating.",Jaguars,2,1576444103,eb1r1l
43,Yeah that should be a penalty imo. 99.9% doesn't change the outcome of this game but still.,Titans,2,1576444099,eb1r1l

46,It's a cheap tactic but I get why they do it.,Jaguars,2,1576444070,eb1r1l
47,Spiking the ball with under 2 seconds left doesnt stop the clock,Titans,1,1576444066,eb1r1l
48,"We're missing like 3 of our starting DBs, so we had to pull people off the line to cover Hop/Fuller/Stills",Titans,2,1576444065,eb1r1l
49,We haven't been good as a defense for a while. Losing Butler and Jackson changed everything.,Titans,1,1576444059,eb1r1l
50,"Holdup. The only thing keeping the Texans down is BOB and you're calling out Vrable??

LMFAO",Titans,0,1576444058,eb1r1l
51,"Kind of bullshit that the defense can try to grab the ball after a sack like that to intentionally run time off the clock. Not saying the Titans would have won, and its within the rules, but that's a lame rule",49ers,6,1576444038,eb1r1l
52,"Yeah I agree, I only saw the one look at the end. Pretty dumb by the refs to not even look at it.",Texans,4,1576444037,eb1r1l
53,We have to win vs New Orleans while they lose vs TB to have an AFC title game. Not happening imo.,Titans,2,1576444035,eb1r1l

56,Just like the Texans will never make it past the divisional round.,Titans,-1,1576444006,eb1r1l
57,Probably? Not saying we were gonna score or anything. But there was 1 second left on the clock.,Titans,1,1576443989,eb1r1l
58,"So while I think you should definitely review the clock there, I definitely dont think everyone had enough time to be set for a full second anyway, so it doesnt *really* matter.",Titans,1,1576443981,eb1r1l
59,They also almost had one taken away because of poor officiating lmfao. Don't act like that was the ONLY play of the game.,Jaguars,1,1576443976,eb1r1l

61,Mike maybe coach a better game instead of bitching at the refs,Texans,-4,1576443963,eb1r1l
62,"I don’t either. The dude legit admitted they weren’t prepared for the Broncos, essentially admitting he didn’t coach a team for a game, &amp; people defended that. If I admitted to not doing my job adequately I’d be fired.",Texans,2,1576443954,eb1r1l
63,There probably should’ve been 1 second left,Texans,8,1576443953,eb1r1l
64,"Wow. Just wow. That fluky red zone int early in the game was the decider. Good game Texans, can't wait for 2 weeks from now.",Titans,7,1576443953,eb1r1l

70,Have you lost by 30 yet today,Titans,4,1576443934,eb1r1l
71,I mean that's objectively false,Titans,1,1576443933,eb1r1l
