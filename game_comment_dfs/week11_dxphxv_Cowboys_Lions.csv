19,"coaching has so much more to do with winning and losing. cowboys calling 2 runs on 2nd and 3 and 3rd and 3 when the run has gone nowhere all game is just a microcosm of the poor decision making that has lead to some of these losses.

also if you‚Äôre throwing out stats, the offense is top 3 in the league, so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs not making plays. 

the losses aren‚Äôt on dak and a few of the wins this year are in a large part thanks to his play. Maybe it‚Äôs to early to call him elite, admitedly he doesn‚Äôt have the successful tenure for that yet. but he‚Äôs definitely playing at an elite level right now, and making plays that your middle of the road quarterback doesn‚Äôt make",,1,1574026205,dxphxv

26,"A 6 man box is only part of the story. How many plays did their safeties come up in run support as a first look or run blitz. How many times did they bite on play action. Dak has shown a lot of progress this year (and is playing much better than I thought him capable of). But Elite is laughable. He‚Äôs has the benefit of an insanely easy schedule, and has a top 3 Rb, top 3 line, top 10 WR core and your defense is still top half in the league. Rodgers has never had any of that and won a SB because he is elite. Brady had that maybe once and set records. Brees has had that and sets records. 

Sorry but elite is an insane word to use with Dak. Throw him on about 50% of teams, and they are worse. He‚Äôs a middle of the road QB. Nothing more",Eagles,1,1574025784,dxphxv

390,I think the idea is if you are going for the win you will need to go for 2 eventually either this TD or the next one. So to increase your chances you do it twice. If you make it here you‚Äôre only down 6 and can win with a PAT next TD if you miss you can still go for 2 next time to tie the game/force an OT. I think with the % of PAT‚Äôs being missed in the NFL it makes going for 2 the safer bet.,Bears,1,1574024420,dxphxv
