563,Holy ass,Colts,3,1575232325,e4kgem
564,Lol I'm so confused.,Titans,6,1575232322,e4kgem
565,Fuck that drive -everyone,Titans,14,1575232317,e4kgem
566,The refs fucked that up in 3 different ways.  How does nobody in charge notice that.,Titans,17,1575232316,e4kgem
567,Lmao refs said fuck both of us,Colts,8,1575232306,e4kgem
568,"Shouldn't we get our timeout back?

Wasn't it originally called a no catch?",Colts,8,1575232297,e4kgem
569,They didnt rule it a catch...,Titans,3,1575232291,e4kgem
570,Wtf is happening,Dolphins,2,1575232289,e4kgem
571,It fucking shouldn't have but sure,Colts,5,1575232288,e4kgem
572,why was the clock not running there,Titans,1,1575232286,e4kgem
573,this is such a total clusterfuck in so many ways,Colts,8,1575232284,e4kgem
574,How is it not 3rd and 1 then? They aren't even consistent with the call.,Titans,5,1575232281,e4kgem
575,It was obviously a fumble but the only reason it wasn’t called was because they blew the play dead. It shouldn’t have even been reviewed because of that,Titans,3,1575232276,e4kgem
576,"No matter what side of the ball you're on, we can all agree, fuck these refs and their bullshit calls",Titans,15,1575232273,e4kgem
577,We both got fucked lol,Titans,2,1575232272,e4kgem
578,"So, I don’t know how, but the refs managed to fuck both the Colts and the Titans on the same replay.",Titans,8,1575232271,e4kgem
579,Wow. They screwed both teams at once.,Colts,18,1575232270,e4kgem
580,If he fumbled it we should get the ball where it went out of bounds,Titans,2,1575232268,e4kgem
581,The refs are so bad. Ball should be where the catch was.,Colts,7,1575232267,e4kgem
582,Nothing about that ruling made sense,Colts,8,1575232265,e4kgem
583,"Good, that should have been our ball.",Titans,-8,1575232263,e4kgem
584,"That stood only because they blew the whistle early. Otherwise that's a fumble, and both teams are fighting for it.",Titans,3,1575232261,e4kgem
585,Even if it was a fumble the ref blew the whistle dead before the ball was grabbed which the commentators aren’t even mentioning...,Titans,7,1575232259,e4kgem
586,Titans should have gotten the yards there,Titans,2,1575232258,e4kgem
587,"Should have been a fumble, but based on the call on the field, the play standing is the right call. The play was dead. If it wasn't, jonnu would have recovered the ball. He stopped playing because the whistle was blown.",Titans,1,1575232257,e4kgem
588,what the fuck are the refs doing??,Titans,2,1575232255,e4kgem
589,Fuck these refs,Titans,4,1575232255,e4kgem
590,I’ll allow it,Titans,0,1575232249,e4kgem
591,They fucked that all up,Titans,8,1575232233,e4kgem
592,Lol that's a rough one for the Colts.,Titans,4,1575232226,e4kgem
593,If they gave us the catch fumble thats a 1st down???  Or close to it.  Fucking nfl refs man,Titans,5,1575232225,e4kgem
594,SO THAT WAS BULLSHIT IN LIKE 3 WAYS,Colts,6,1575232222,e4kgem
595,The one thing it wasn't was an incomplete,Dolphins,5,1575232218,e4kgem

599,The /r/colts game threads are toxic every week now.,Colts,2,1575232213,e4kgem
600,It's a catch but it's 3rd down? lol,Titans,6,1575232209,e4kgem
601,"So it *was* a fumble, but they’re not giving them the ball at the spot?",Colts,8,1575232207,e4kgem
602,Wow... we just got fucked!!!,Colts,-1,1575232190,e4kgem

605,Lesser of two evils,Titans,1,1575232181,e4kgem
606,That is actual bullshit.,Colts,3,1575232179,e4kgem
607,If they call it complete I don't think they can give you the ball because there was so much time between the whistle and the recovery. Call will probably stand so they don't give us 10 free yards,Titans,2,1575232172,e4kgem
608,was going to be a horseshit call either way,Titans,2,1575232171,e4kgem

613,This is gonna screw is. I can feel it.,Titans,2,1575232145,e4kgem
614,Our second best option is Dion Lewis who hasn’t done nearly as well with us as he did with the Patriots. He’s sort of notorious amongst fans for running straight into defenders.,Titans,1,1575232142,e4kgem
615,He gave up getting the ball because the ref blew the whistle.,Titans,2,1575232135,e4kgem
616,That’s *absolutely* a fumble. This is why you don’t blow the play dead while the ball is bouncing round...,Colts,11,1575232135,e4kgem
617,Nobody had the ball when the play was called dead though. I'm not sure what the actual rule on that is though since I can't remember it happening before.,Titans,1,1575232134,e4kgem
618,Nfl refs are an absolute joke,,1,1575232133,e4kgem
619,"yeah i mean, it shouldnt of been blown dead",Titans,2,1575232131,e4kgem
620,The best part about going to the game threads in the colts and titans sub is both think they're about to get fucked by the refs,Colts,12,1575232126,e4kgem
621,"God, fuck refball",Titans,3,1575232124,e4kgem
622,Bullshit either way. It was a fumble whistled dead with our guy going to recover it.,Titans,2,1575232118,e4kgem
623,"Brown stopped going for the ball because they blew the whistle. What absolute horse shit if they overturn the play.

Get the call wrong on the field
Affect outcome of the play both ways
Retroactively go back and reverse the call on the field but that doesn't reverse the actions the players had as a result of the wrong call


Play to the whistledoesn't mean shit these days haha",Titans,1,1575232118,e4kgem

625,"NFL REFS ARE SO BAD AT THEIR JOBS, DONT BLOW THE FUCKING WHISTLE EVEN IF ITS CLOSE, LET ALONE AN ACTUAL CATCH AND FUMBLE. Every single week i am just amazed at how awful refs are, why does this shit never happen in college football????",,9,1575232106,e4kgem
626,"Yea, neither did you until after the whistle was blown, bud.",Titans,2,1575232098,e4kgem
627,"Exactly, if they reverse this play its a slap in the face to player safety",Titans,1,1575232087,e4kgem
628,This is the only comment I can agree with 😂,Colts,3,1575232082,e4kgem
629,It should because our players obviously stopped going for it once it was blown dead,Titans,5,1575232082,e4kgem
630,What was Jonnu trying to do instead of falling on the ball?,Titans,1,1575232079,e4kgem
631,Colts are going to get ref dicked out of a turnover on this one.  God I'm so sick of these garbage refs every game.,Colts,1,1575232069,e4kgem
632,We may get the 10 yards and the ball 🤷‍♂️,Titans,2,1575232066,e4kgem
633,This is how you get players hitting each other after the whistle too.,Titans,4,1575232063,e4kgem
634,"that's what I'm thinking, play was ruled dead before the recovery.",Colts,2,1575232048,e4kgem
635,"Seems legit as a fumble, but it also seems likely to stand as incomplete.",Colts,7,1575232036,e4kgem
636,"Should have gotten the ball, doubt it would get reversed anyway but the whistle blowing really should end it.",Texans,2,1575232028,e4kgem
637,There has to be an immediate recovery and I doubt that this qualifies.,Titans,1,1575232019,e4kgem
638,They blew it dead before he jumped on it. Does that matter?,Dolphins,11,1575232018,e4kgem
639,What are you talking about? Our guys would have had the recovery but they stopped at the whistle,Titans,-4,1575232016,e4kgem
640,Yes,Colts,1,1575232014,e4kgem
641,It's already waved off before a recovery so how can you argue it's recoverable?,Titans,10,1575232010,e4kgem
642,"I'd be pissed if this is overturned, we clearly stopped fighting once the whistle was blown.",Titans,13,1575232009,e4kgem
643,Yeah you guys never had it or were close bud,Colts,-3,1575232006,e4kgem
644,They did it to us in the game vs the Dolphins last year.,Titans,1,1575232006,e4kgem
645,whatever is going to happen is gonna be bullshit,Titans,9,1575232001,e4kgem
646,"I mean, the whistle was blown, and titans players stopped playing. How can they fairly justify giving it to indy if they overturn it? The play was dead.",Titans,11,1575232000,e4kgem
647,"Definitely a fumble, but they blew it dead so I don’t think it can be reasonably overturned",Titans,10,1575231996,e4kgem
648,"Im rioting if they reverse this.  They blew the god damn whistle, titans players stopped going for it because you PLAY UNTIL THE WHISTLE",Titans,9,1575231994,e4kgem

652,"“Play til the whistle!”
Also refs: “we blew the whistle but they got the ball after it so they keep it”",Titans,12,1575231966,e4kgem
