0,"I don't think you'll find a single Wisconsinite that hates Stafford.  He's good, he's tough, he's been a franchise QB for the same team for a decade.  Nothing bad to say about him.",Packers,1,1574644660,e11i8x
1,"This is the second Packers fan compliment to Stafford I’ve seen today.

I mean it’s easy to admit Rodgers is great but fuck him and his mustache.",Lions,1,1574644512,e11i8x
2,"I kinda understand the confusion.  From my perspective from following on the ESPN app and the thread, I thought the clock stayed at 16 seconds as if the clock operator did not start the clock.  Then after the completion, we had a review.  Without seeing a TV, my understanding was that they were reviewing the clock to see what it should be at.  And, since a review occurred, I somehow though that this would lead to the rule on a 10 second runoff as we are not in the lead.",Lions,1,1574640091,e11i8x

4,"Maybe I read your post wrong, but it's a runoff because the result of a change was a running clock, not because of clock operator error",Packers,2,1574631415,e11i8x
5,"Excuse the hot take, but I think Stafford might be a really good QB.",Packers,2,1574631391,e11i8x
6,"You might need to clarify.  The game was stopped for a review when the clock should be running.  Given the circumstances, that would be a 10-second runoff had they been checking under my current understanding.  We can use a timeout to stop the clock and thus negate the runoff before it occurs.

Where did I go wrong?",Lions,1,1574631115,e11i8x
7,Not nearly enough tape yet. The coaches are not doing him any favors and the o line is pretty bad. Next season will tell. I think he'll be a mediocre starter a la Jameis or Mariota.,Redskins,1,1574630708,e11i8x

12,Eh.  We got 14 points in that game from starting past the 50 and our last 6 was kinda bordering on garbage time.,Lions,2,1574630557,e11i8x

18,"I think it's still early to give up on Haskins. Redskins are a trash team, fired their HC, and he hasn't even started a full season.
If Mitch Trubiskys can finesse his way to be a starter, then maybe Haskins has a shot at being an NFL QBs starter long term. We need more games and at least another year before we call it.",,5,1574630397,e11i8x

23,"Nice seeing Haskins smile for once. I think he'll be the QB here for at least another season, so I'd rather see him get some wins than tank for a draft pick that's not going to make any difference. We need players at like 10 different positions, one draft pick will make zero difference. I'd rather see us trade down for more picks.",Redskins,5,1574630363,e11i8x
