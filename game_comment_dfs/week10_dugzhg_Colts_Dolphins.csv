1451,"I, along with many of you, have been seeing the Rams Pizza Hut Ad. In this ad, Aaron Donald is outlining the food he bought from Pizza Hut, standing before the expansive set of Food. When Todd Gurley tries to take a wing Donald swats him away and says ""Buy your own"". This just hurts me because I've had ""friends"" who weren't loyal to me at all and would totally do me like that. They talk to me at school, when no one better to talk to is there, but as soon as another guy higher on the totem pole walks in, I get tossed aside. I'm not saying they should exclusively talk to me, but at least include me in the conversation. And these people never invite me to anything. I haven't gone to something in three months, when I ask them why they don't invite me to anything, they deny they go anywhere but I see their posts on their social media accounts. I deserve real friends. NFL and Pizza Hut shouldn't be exalting this behavior.",Cowboys,9,1573418322,dugzhg
