Make the 2 pt conversion, kick XP:  40% * 100% = 40% to WIN
Miss the 2 pt conversion, make the 2nd 2 point conversion  60% * 40% = 24% to TIE = 12% to win.

I thought not. It's not a story the Eagles would tell you, it's an NFC legend.

Darth 3Li was a Dark Lord of the Giants, so powerful and so wise he could use the Memes to influence the NFL to create Super Bowl wins... He had such a knowledge of the Patriots defense that he could even keep the ones he cared about from losing 2 Super Bowls. The dark side of the Memes is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his starting job, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice took his starting job from him in Week 3. He could save others from failure, but not himself.

There's also Eli's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realise that they're not just effective- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Eli Manning truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Eli's existential nickname ""3li,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. 

I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Pay Shurmer's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

Third and fourth drive he‚Äôs looked sharp. Putting players in the right position pre-snap, making throws to the side of receiver to avoid tackle/allow a play (like the long TD catch and run on 3rd down to Slayton). Threw a 42 yard bomb to Slayton next drive. Good play action roll out after that. Should‚Äôve had a touchdown after splitting the zone defense on a long second and goal (after penalty) to Tate but great athletic lay out by linebacker to tip ball away.

Say you have a TV worth $500 and you advertise it for $20. 100 people bid their $20, only 1 wins. That's $2k you grossed, minus the $480 you lost on the TV, for a net of $1,520. This is just a quick example. 


The key is to have seemingly valuable items priced ridiculously low. These items need to attract as many bidders as possible. Only one can win and losers dont get their bids back.

So, the vet suggested using a small dropper tube to insert the medicine directly into his anus. The first time was absolute hell, my cat fought me the whole time but once the tube was in and the medicine pushed out he seemed to calm quite a bit. Well the next day he was acting strange, he has always been an independent cat, rarely coming around, never wanting to be held, but as I sat on the couch he started walking back and forth meowing and rubbing my leg. He then went and jumped up on the table where we‚Äôd done the application the night before and meowed louder and louder until I decided I guess we will go ahead and do the medicine treatment. This time he didn‚Äôt fight me though, and when I inserted the tube he closed his eyes, stretched his neck, and let out a noise that can only be described as a moan of pure ecstasy. Maybe the medicine made him feel better, I supposed. That night he slept on my bed curled up right next to me, which he had never done before. For the next week he‚Äôd do the same thing every day, meow on the table until he got his ‚Äòfix‚Äô... But then the medicine ran out. Even though I had no medicine he‚Äôd still cry and beg for it, I thought maybe if I insert it without medicine he will realize it doesn‚Äôt make him feel better anymore and forget about it. Well that was 2 weeks ago and he is only getting worse. He walks around me all day with his tail up presenting his rectum and trying to entice me. He is demanding insertions more and more often. Yesterday I caught him looking longingly at the turkey baster... When I sit he jumps in my lap purring and rubbing me affectionately. It was then in horror I realized my cat thinks I‚Äôm his gay lover, and that I‚Äôve been sexually pleasing him for weeks now. Needless to say the sexual tension between us is palpable.
