10,He was. Originally thought he was ineligible when the play happened but I rewound and did see he was behind the line. Shame the announcers weren't able to explain that play. They mentioned the flag and then said nothing else about it,Eagles,1,1575251640,e4kgg2
11,"Yeah, but we also have so many holes to address. Depending on cost, Burrow may still be worth it, but I'd say it's pretty unlikely the Bengals would give him up unless they decided to go with Dalton again after today.

We also have a ton of cap space (obviously bc of how barren our roster is), so there is potential to get a lot better next year via the draft and FA IF we play it right.

Basically, I hope we are ready to compete when Brady and/or BB decide to move on.",Dolphins,1,1575245935,e4kgg2
