4,I can tell you don’t watch much Falcons football. O-line and defense are the two biggest reasons we suck.,Falcons,1,1575254077,e3746m
5,All you did was say a veteran QB who is top 10 in passing yards is garbage and provided no reasoning as to why you think so. Vikings guy gets W here.,Falcons,1,1575254015,e3746m

11,"What are you talking about? The Superdome tickets have been sold out and attendance has been steady ever since 2007. I thought you were about to ask if I was a fan during the Aaron Brook era, because we had a decent crowd even at that time.

Your comment is just as empty as the Falcons stadium last night.",Saints,1,1575063855,e3746m
12,"The idea that everyone was doing it to the level the saints were has no evidence. Only saints fans say that. Y'all were at fault and you know it.

It gets brought up because the people that were responsible are still in the organization. They got off real light for the cowards they are. 

Also, were you a fan during those years the saints sucked? The superdome was so empty you could hear Drew Brees hit the ground every time he got sacked. Don't tell me about fairweather ""passion."" You're pathetic and I'd recommend not responding because at this point you're just embarrassing yourself.",Falcons,1,1575062913,e3746m
13,"I seem really angry that a team that I am passionate about getting bullshit punishment for something that everyone was doing and no evidence was produced that justified the punishment? I seem really angry that a team I am passionate about is constantly associated with this thing that you sought to bring up almost a decade after it happened?

Oh that’s right, you’re a Falcons fan. You don’t know what passion for a team feels like. Your brain for debate is just as empty at the Falcon’s stadium last night.",Saints,1,1575061488,e3746m

18,"I wasn't going to respond because it's a stale game thread. You seem *really* angry about this and I find that pretty hilarious.

Fact of the matter is your team got found guilty for it, and none of your rambling is going to change what they did. You know it's true, and the fact that you're ranting on a stale game thread several levels down on Reddit is plainly pathetic.",Falcons,1,1575052963,e3746m

20,"You just going to ignore the question to your post? Or do you not have a logical answer?
Football is a violent sport where everyone is told to hit the other person as hard as they can. If we were not flagged excessively during that season and we were just playing violent football and hitting other players really hard, how is that cheating? You’re trying to allude to people being paid to intensionally hurt other players. In what way were other players hurt by the Saints outside of legally or unpenalized by the refs?  You have times the NFL said the Saints paid out a bounty for knocking a player out of a game where NO ONE was knocked out of the game.
But I’ll digress back to the Super Bowl. WHO WAS THE PLAYER THAT WE INJURED OR EVEN TACKLED VIOLENTLY THAT KNOCKED THEM OUT OF THE GAME THAT WILL GIVE EVIDENCE TO YOUR BELIEF THAT THE SAINTS CHEATED IN THE SUPER BOWL TO WIN THE SUPER BOWL?

You. Do. Not. Have. The. Proof. To. Back. Up. Your. Jaded. Statement.

22,"Um, the Falcons still gotta play the 49ers.",,1,1575051286,e3746m
23,Thats why I said the play calling did nothing to help them. It was an all around team effort that cost them the game.,,1,1575051199,e3746m
24,also doesn't help when he has to wait for his receivers to open up in intermediate routes while he doesnt have a checkdown because his running backs are too busy failing at blocks.,,1,1575051187,e3746m
25,Doesn't help when he has to wait for his receivers to open up 20 yards down the field while his running backs aren't available for a checkdown because they tryna prevent the saints from getting 15 sacks instead of 9,,1,1575051036,e3746m

32,Three turnovers forced by the Saints and only six points to show for it. 7 penalties for 111 yards. Payton has to be pissed.,,1,1575035023,e3746m
33,Do not forget he missed an easy FG and an Extra point.  Bring on Goggles please.,Falcons,1,1575024879,e3746m
34,"The thing is, I wonder what Matt Ryan could have been with a few years of the same good O-Coordinator.  We got a glimpse with Shannahan.  If somehow the Falcons had Sean Payton the last few years instead of the 2 years of that, 3 years of that and so on, if Brees would even still be in the league.

He was not exactly lighting it up in SD, and hell they drafted first and picked another QB and they promptly traded the number 1 to the NYG for the 2nd pick QB.  

Just something to ponder.",Falcons,1,1575024753,e3746m

87,"I don’t think you paid close enough attention to the game then. Their defensive touchdown shouldn’t have counted due to a face mask no call and Seattle dropped so many interceptions. That particular game should’ve have even been close. I’ll hear injuries as an excuse for that game but that’s it. It shouldn’t have been close. Besides, the cardinals almost beat them twice too and kyler did a solid job of shitting on the defense that murdered Aaron Rodgers both times.

The point I’m making is the reason the QB would decide to dump off to a place he thinks a receiver will be before the receiver actually cuts in that direction is because he’s desperately trying to avoid a sack. Otherwise he’d wait a half beat longer to make sure the receiver broke in the direction he expected him to.,Patriots,1,1574999821,e3746m

7427,"&gt;I come from impoverished areas.

So did I, so you're not alone.

&gt;throwing money at it doesn't solve shit.

Guess what? Deshaun Watson benefitted from it. Immensely. Now he's in Houston doing the same thing because he knows what it did from him. You can't apply simple logic like, ""Doing X doesn't solve shit..."" when there are results that it has clearly helped.

&gt;90% of my peers are stuck in the impoverished areas going no where with their lives and making babies.

Of course and this is the problem? Ain't shit in the hood but liquor stores on every corner. We all know the problem, so what are we going to do to fix it? Let me guess, they have all of those babies and getting a shit ton of food stamps, right? 😂😂🤣

This is another problem, you have government programs that are set up to help people (which is a good thing because we all need some help) but you have people who abuse it. Like if they're getting $600+ in food stamps, why would they want to get out and work or try to improve their situation when they won't ever get much for food again? These government programs need be changed but *also* people in impoverished areas also feel like their opportunities are less limited as well. So at the same time we have to make opportunities available in that way **I** wouldn't feel like my hard work (I work hard for my money) isn't going towards something that I knowingly know people are abusing. Since I make ""too much"" I can't even get anything.

8662,"My name is Younghoe Koo. I'm 25 years old. My team is in the northeast section of Georgia, where Atlanta is, and I am not married. I work as an kicker for the Atlanta Falcons, and I get home every day by 12 PM at the latest. I don't punt, but I occasionally kick.

I'm in bed by 1 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of kicking exercise before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last practice. 

I'm trying to explain that I'm a kicker who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any statistics, like making kicks and missing kicks, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with the NFL, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to kick, I wouldn't make it.",Saints,1,1574996075,e3746m

They kick the field goal at the two yard line -&gt; Saints gets normal field position. Anything could happen there, anything from 3-and-out, where your scenario makes it better, or them getting a touchdown and making it 14-3. Big unknown.

However, pinning them back 23 yards makes it so much less likely of them getting anything going. And also easier for the Falcons to get the touchdown. Less of an unknown.

In general, the best case scenario down a touchdown is getting a touchdown. Going for it on the 2 yard is the most likely way of getting it.",Eagles,1,1574995124,e3746m

Brett Favre wanted to go to the Vikings in 2008. What if Brett Favre was a Viking? Brett Favre became a Viking the next year and gave them a good season.

Brett Favre wanted to the Packers to trade for Randy Moss. What if Randy Moss and Brett Favre were on the same team? The Vikings traded for Randy Moss eventually.

What I DONT like are Saints fans. They’re like the preteens on Call of Duty. If the Saints beat another team, it’s because they’re the best team ever. If they lose, it’s because there’s a massive conspiracy against them. The other team cheated and they were aided by the refs. That’s a pretty common reaction, but Saints fans are far more vocal.

The double-standard is hilarious as well. They’ll sit there and bitch day and night saying the Rams didn’t deserve to be in the Super Bowl, that they were illegitimate due to the bad officiating. However not one feels there should be an asterisk next to their own Super Bowl win due to defeating the Vikings in a controversially officiated NFCCG.

The issue was raised after the 2009 playoffs and dismissed because there was no evidence.

A few years later Goodell gets more powers on punishments and reopens the case, outside investigators found no evidence again. Yet Goodell said there is ""mountains of evidence"" he just refused to release any of it outside of one soundbite. edit: there was other evidence ""leaked"" but none of it proved the bounty program. For example, the league claimed ""cart-off"" pay outs for certain games that had no injuries, went back and said it was for a different game which also had no injuries. Released a ""bounty"" power point by Gregg Williams that was just their gameplan themed after Dog the Bounty Hunter. So in other words, the league kept claiming they had evidence and released stuff that didnt say what they said it did

Favre and Warner both came out and said they didnt feel anything against them was malicious

Saints were in the bottom third in the league in personal fouls, and injured the second least amount of players

No players or coaches ever admitted to bountygate, the only thing that was proved was the saints had a pay for performance pool, that rewarded players for sacks, interceptions, fumbles etc. and that players had to pay into if they committed penalty's.

But yes, lets all just believe Goodell because he's never done anything shady",,0,1574990387,e3746m
