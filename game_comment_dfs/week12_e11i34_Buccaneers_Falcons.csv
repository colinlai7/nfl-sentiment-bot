1,"Are we sure he was, or was it Pete Carrol, because I have watched this putrid D for 5 years.  Players not communicating, players out of position, players being undisciplined.  In one drive, the same DT got defensive holding on run plays, not once but twice.  A hold when the other team is running the ball, twice.  And DQ smiles and fist bumps him after the other team scored a TD, helped by two defensive holding calls on a run play on 3rd down.

Does this sound like a guy you want running your D?  Because it sure as hell is someone I want running the Gators D.  He reminds me of the really bad Todd Grantham, back in the day the players would be looking at the sideline when the ball was snapped.",Falcons,1,1574636394,e11i34
