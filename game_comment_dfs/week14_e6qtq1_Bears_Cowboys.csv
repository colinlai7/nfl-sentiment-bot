Does your bro like pork chops and such? Iowa has the absolute best pork IN THE WORLD. Hands down. Nobody from England, France, Germany, Japan, or anywhere in the US come even close.

But Iowa beef is also so special that we have our own breed of Hereford cow that is listed in the French encyclopedia ""LaRousse La Gastronomique"" which is the official French government encyclopedia of food. That and Maytag Blue cheese, which the French greatly respect.

The NFC East teams have massive fan bases, yes Dallas is the biggest but the others are also huge, and most importantly loyal (they deliver ratings whether the teams are good or bad). Why do you think the NFL force feeds us Giants primetime games even when they‚Äôre garbage? Just the people who are giants fans will deliver a huge rating, and if they play another NFC east team the ratings will be huge. People like to watch their team play more than they like to watch good football.

64,Unfortunately yes. Our team has pretty much been just good ebough to give us fucking hope for the last 20 years.

65,"A matchup between two goliaths from mid markets would not be outdrawn a couple mediocre big market teams. Dallas may be the only exception, but the general rule is that good teams draw and bad teams don't. Why else did the NYJ/NE rating tank earlier this season? Indy used to draw huge national ratings during the Peyton era. STL drew huge ratings during the greatest show on turf days. People want to watch good teams. The KC-Rams game last year was the biggest MNF rating in half a decade. That's a matchup between two teams that are probably in the bottom half of the league in terms of fan following. 

Would the NFL prefer teams like Dallas, Chicago, NE, etc be at the top of the heap rather than the Bills, Titans, and Bengals? Sure. But in the end things are generally going to even out ratings wise. In a different year, it could be a team like the Cowboys that leapfrogs the Lions and benefits from a postseason shakeup. Honestly I'm kind of hoping a 6-10 team wins the East and two 10-win teams get sent home after week 17 so that this is addressed. You would never see this in the other major sports leagues, and it's an embarrassment that it is happening in the NFL.",Bears,1,1575622965,e6qtq1

68,"Because the divisions are organized (roughly) by TV market, the system is designed to keep all areas of the country interested as late as possible.

This year perfectly illustrates why the system works: the NFC East is by far the most important division for television, nobody cares about a Packers Bears game in week 17 compared to the massive fan bases involved in the Cowboys-Eagles week 16 game.

It‚Äôs better for the league to have ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Game of the Week‚Äù or ‚ÄúSunday Night Football‚Äù between two huge market 7-8 teams than between two small market 12-3 teams. Sometimes it works the other way, like when you had a week 17 SNF between the 7-8 rams and 6-9 Seahawks back in 2010, two midsize markets, but in a case like this year it works perfectly where it keeps the NFC East relevant.

In fact I‚Äôd go so far as to say that the NFC East is the division this entire thing is mainly designed to keep relevant in case of emergency (like this year), as really all the other divisions pale in comparison to the TV market size of the NFC East teams",,1,1575620170,e6qtq1

70,"True, I was never good at math.",,1,1575618391,e6qtq1
71,"Dude, who gives a shit about making games between terrible teams relevant? This is your argument? 

Bc of the NFCE, the Vikings-Bears game to close the season is irrelevant. It would be relevant, however, if a team like the Bears could leapfrog the Eagles or Cowboys. So it's not like there is more intrigue just bc you say there is. And those Rams games would absolutely matter since they would be fighting for their playoff lives with other non NFCE teams on their tail. These lost intriguing games would be replaced by others involving teams that are on the outside looking in because of this divisional nonsense. The correct solution is to either allow a .500 or worse divisional winner to be leapfrogged or have two divisions per conference, not four. Otherwise, you will get seasons like this one where you'll have a team with 25-43% more wins than a team hosting a playoff game not even getting a postseason berth. The whole point of the playoffs is to have the best teams emerge into a condensed tournament. Best of the best squaring off. When teams make it in that are not only weaker than you'd expect of a typical playoff team, but are legitimately bad teams and significantly worse than teams that do not make it, it indeed exposes a serious flaw in the system. Period. It's not like this can't be fixed, and at some point it's likely the NFL will make a change.",Bears,1,1575618295,e6qtq1

If both good teams got in and the bad team didn‚Äôt, it would remove all the intrigue from both teams‚Äô games down the stretch, by making all the 49ers-Rams-Seahawks games against each other relatively meaningless if they all are getting in anyway, and it would make the Cowboys-Eagles game completely meaningless if neither team can get in.

129,"O.K., real fast . . . here's [Omaha Steaks Porterhouse](https://www.omahasteaks.com/product/T-Bone-Steaks-00000004733?ITMSUF=WZB&amp;shoptype=PROMOTION&amp;shopsrc=PRMT-Bones+%26+Porterhouses). First of all, it's wildly overpriced. Secondly, look at the meat in the picture. The problem I had with Omaha Steaks is that their meat was sort of rubbery; it didn't ""melt in your mouth"", it wasn't tough, but it had way too much bite to it. Also, even in their promotional picture they couldn't make it look juicy. And it's corn-fed.

Now here's a [T-bone from an Iowa supplier.](https://www.southerniowabeefsupply.com/product-page/t-bone-steak) What we call a T-Bone they call a Porterhouse (the difference between a T-bone and a Porterhouse is that a porterhouse has to be at least 1.5"" thick and the tenderloin side of the bone i.e. the small side has to be at least 2.5"" wide. We're cutting our T-bones like Porterhouses).

So you're thinking, ""Hey Jester . . . where's all the marbling?"" Well, this is grass-fed. So the grains of meat are connected much looser and the meat has a lot more flavor packed into it. It's much richer and hormone-free (Omaha Steaks are going to be chock full of steroids and antibiotics because corn is not a natural food source for cattle and they tend to get sick and die if you don't pump them full of meds.) And the price per lb. is *waaay* better.

This is just what I got off the top of my head. Just check it out or google ""Iowa Beef Retail"" or ""Wisconsin beef retail"" and you'll find a lot better quality steaks than Omaha fucking ripoff Steaks.

During garbage time, the trailing team can sometimes rack up an unusually high tally of statistics, leading the respective box score to be misleading with respect to their actual game performance. For instance, in American football, if the losing team is behind by several touchdowns, the offense may resort entirely to the passing game in a futile effort to catch up. At the same time, the leading team (on defense, with second or third string players) may allow them to complete plays (which benefits them by running out the clock). This may lead the statistics to indicate a high amount of passing yards for the losing squad, which would suggest the team performed better than in reality.",,1,1575607367,e6qtq1

2908,"Guys, I think I‚Äôm done.

I‚Äôve watched the cowboys since I was barely old enough to understand the game

I was born in 93, so that was after the glory day‚Äôs of ole

At first, they just weren‚Äôt good with no good QB. It‚Äôs ok, every franchise goes through down times. The NFL is all about parody, so it‚Äôs not realistic to expect a championship every 5 years

Then they got competitive when we found the diamond in the rough that was Tony Romo. My first game was watching his magical 3rd down scramble when the center snapped it over his head

The Romo years were almost more painful than the bad ones. We had talent, and Romo showed he had the skill and understanding to be able to take us there, but we never had the defense to keep him from having to win every game

This lead to a lot of barely missed playoff seasons and crushing playoffs exits

Then, our front office actually starts building a team from the ground up, the o line is STACKED. Dez is a beast, and our defense is just good enough to give us a shot against anyone

Then the ‚ÄúDez caught it catch‚Äù happens, and that was the biggest blow yet. It had been so long (my whole life) since we had made it that far in the playoffs, and our chance to close out the game is robbed from Romo and Cowboys nation

Then Romo goes down... and all hope seemed lost. Season is over before it started

But wait a second, who is this Dak kid? Are we really competitive? Did we really just stomp the Packers?? DID WE JUST BEAT THE STEELERS?!? HOLY SHIT, WE HAVE A FIRST ROUND BYE!!!

Then Rogers (and another lackluster defense) happens....

And since then, nothing seemed to click like it did that year...

Until this young cat name Cooper gets traded. Ok, that should help, but this team just isn‚Äôt playoff material...

Wait a second, we just won 5 straight games....

Holy shit we just won a Fucking playoff game, our first since Romo!!!

...and then we get DESTROYED by the Rams. Score was closer than it looked, we were clearly outmatched. Outdated offense philosophy meets 21st century play calling

Hold up, not only did we end the year a top half defense for the first time since the Super Bowl days, we just got a new aged offensive coordinator in the offseason. We added Cobb, we have Fredrick back, we got some good looking talent

Guys, I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE YEAR.

I know, it‚Äôs never come that close to happening before, but I think with new playcalling, we can finally have a top 10 offense AND defense. That‚Äôs how you win a championship.

First 3 games of the season go as well as you could have hoped.

Then we proceed to have the biggest let down of a season I have EVER. FUCKING. SEEN.

How do you look THIS BAD, with THIS MUCH TALENT?!?

I don‚Äôt know what it is. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Garrett, if Dak really isn‚Äôt the guy, or if Jerry just can‚Äôt keep his face out of the camera and keep his hand out of the teams decisions enough to allow for a functional organization, but one thing is for sure

I WILL NEVER NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BY THIS TEAM

I‚Äôm a die hard Mavericks fan, and guess what. They finally did it and overcame their own version of Dallas Disappointment.

Took them way longer than it should have with being a top team as long as they were, but they finally got it figured out with a good owner, an awesome roster that was DEEP and experienced, and the best coach in the league being Pop

And guess what, after the championship hangover, THEY ARE BACK AGAIN!

That is what 20+ years of fandom should look like

I don‚Äôt need a championship every year, but just give me fucking 1, or at least progress that doesn‚Äôt just make it hurt worse

This Cowboys organization is simply INCAPABLE of being anything more than a hot topic, and an ATM for our Billionaire overlord

I‚Äôm done.

I can‚Äôt anymore.

This is literally not good for me and my mental health

All this anticipation and anxiety for what... another first round playoff exit if the Eagles just refuse to win games??

Next season we will lose talent because we have a lot of players on their last year.

Our draft this year gave us nothing.

And worst of all, no self respecting coach is going to want to be Jerry‚Äôs little bitch like Garrett was

There is no hope.

There is no future for this organization

I'm thinking climax is inevitable and my eyes go kinda wide.  

There on the wall above me was a framed $100 bill.  That's odd.  What's even more strange is it didn't have the familiar face of Benjamin Franklin on it.  It had Emmit Smith's face!

14907,"In the last two seasons, Trubisky has a TD% of 8.68%. However, the league average last year was 4.8%. If you adjust his TD% to 5%, still above LA, he goes from throwing 57 TDs in his last 18 games to only 32.85. I'll be generous and give him 33.
Now, let's adjust his passer rating. It goes from 116.5 to only 104.3 by just adjusting his TD% to normally above average. Later on, I will adjust it further to take yards into account.

Next, we have to account for him passing more than league average. He has 657 pass attempts over 18 games. The LA is 35.5/game, which equals 639, around a 2.7% reduction. Trubisky also has a flukey 9.01 Y/A, which can be adjusted to 8 (still above LA) based on the league average of 7.5.
So we can estimate that over a 16 game season, his adjusted yardage is (6397.5)/1816= 4544 yards.

Now, I will adjust his passer rating again based on these 16 game stats

4544 yards

639 attempts

426 completions (also adjusted)

After this, his passer rating bottoms out at 96.66, which lands him squarely between Dak Prescott and Ben Roethlisberger last year.

His final 16 game adjusted stats:

4544 yards / 639 ATT / 426 CMP / 66.7% CMP (same) / 33 TD / 12 INT (same) / 8 Y/A / 96.7 RATE

What does this tell us?

It tells us that Trubisky perceived failures in the league is largely inflated by unsustainable, wildly outlier stats in his 18 games as perceived backup QB talent. When you adjust for the future by bringing down his outlier stats, he advances heavily to a slightly above average HOF QB of 2012 Manning-esque.",Bears,1,1575600652,e6qtq1

There's a Classic Skating Family Fun Center about 15 minutes from BYU campus that's usually filled with families and their kids with a handful of college/high school students. On Saturday nights it's disco night, so you dress up in disco gear with glow sticks, etc.

Anyway, I'm there with a gal and we're skating around having fun when this truck of a man with tattoos all over his arms skates past us backwards. You can tell he's been here before. He's got his headphones in, grooving to his own tunes, skating in circles around little kids. I think to myself ""Damn, what a man.""

After a while he goes and sits down and I see his face: Mitchell Trubisky. He's smiling to himself and still jamming to his tunes. All the small Caucasian children of Provo are intrigued, and one by one they go up to him. Pretty soon there are like ten kids all around him. I skate around the ring again, and by the time I'm back, there's a little girl hanging around his neck and all the little kids are asking to feel his muscles. He asks if he can have some of their tootsie rolls and now all the kids are going to spend their gaming tickets on tootsie rolls to give Mitch They ask him if he's famous. He asks them if THEY'RE famous.

After a while I bump into him and I'm like ""Baby M you've got the moves!"" And he's like ""I come here all the time man."" And I'm like, ""With guys on the team?"" And he's like ""Nah Bro sometimes I just gotta dance.""
