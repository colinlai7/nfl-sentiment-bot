I can't explain it because that is never the case. The kicking team has to control it. In fact, if the kicking team just touches it without controlling it, the receiving team can try to pick it up and return it free of consequences(even if they were to fumble it, the ball would stay in their possession at the point the ball was originally touched by the kicking team).

The last few weeks the browns win streak is because they've called the plays that made them successful last season which I think was someone else's gameplan. The first part of the season and this game is kitchens idea of what the offense should be which is where you see Baker getting immediate pressure and he ends up running around until he gets sacked. His strength is in the get rid of the ball right away, quick slants, play action to set up the deep ball, and for some reason kitchens doesn't call these plays, I think because he wants to force his own idea of what this team should be on them rather than doing what works.",,1,1575232505,e4kghq
