4,Every week that they’ve had a losable game. The games Ive had circled for a month for them to potentially lose were the 49ers and buffalo. It would be less painful if the ravens just blew them out but they were both close games. Pats losing this afternoon means the ravens have a 2 game lead so it’s essentially over.,,1,1575875172,e7wj9u
5,"Again.   Their defense keeps scores so low, the offense is allowed to run a front running offense.  The whole playbook is open. 

I use Lamar Jackson because he is one that is particularly benefiting, especially since he runs too.    Russell Wilson had the same advantage for his efficiency early in his career because LOB held scores low too.",Seahawks,1,1575871523,e7wj9u

7,"You initially said 

""Lamar Jacksons stats get inflated by Defense and special teams a lot 

When you see things like successful scoring drives % and TDs being brought up...""

I gave you stats showing that they have the fewest offensive drives in the NFL with the highest scoring efficiency, and a middle of the pack average starting field position. That all points to being able to sustain drives, not getting short fields. The only way that your initial statement makes sense in this light is if you change ""Lamar Jackson"" to ""all qb's,"" in which case, sure a QBs stats do depend on the defense, in the same way a defense's stats depend on the offense staying on the field extending drives, and a kicker's stats depend on the offence scoring TDs or at least getting into FG range. But to single out Jackson in a way that makes it seem like he is the only one who this affects is disingenuous. 

As for the whole he doesnt have to pass bit, he's 17th in the league in passing yards this year, smack dab in the middle. And there are several quarters of games he hasn't even played in because we were up by so much. Plus, when you're ahead by 3 scores, you tend not to pass as much later in the game.",Ravens,1,1575865137,e7wj9u

19,"And as I said.  Defense keeping the opponents with a low score allows their offense to utilize its full playbook and control the game and clock, it allows them to be efficient.    Lamar never *has* to pass, gets to be a front running offense.  The special teams also keeps a shorter field for a “score” because Tucker is a beast.     None of your stats prove these statements as false.",Seahawks,1,1575847770,e7wj9u

21,"Oh they absolutely were. I guess that, for me, it was a great game because we actually hung with you guys—one of the elite teams in the league. I didn’t expect to win, but I was hoping. We were within one score.

In this case, you're projecting being an antagonistic fan onto Ravens fans. Turns out, I was right. As I said before, you can swap any fanbase into either of our team's positions and they would react the same way to the atrocious officiating.

Somebody with your post history can't be like ""Well, my experience with Ravens fans was bad so I'm not rooting for them."" while not in any way shape or form being a fun person to interact with as a Ravens fan.

94,"Ok, so lets break the stats down a little. The Ravens currently have the MOST yards per drive in the NFL at 44.96, so that runs counter to your point that their defense gives them better starting field position and that is why they have so many scores. They also have the fewest number of drives at 112, so it's not that they're getting more chances, but at 3.31 points per drive and 0.393 TD's per drive they are just the most efficient offense in the NFL right now. Also throw in there the fewest punts per drive a 0.214 and tied for fewest 3 &amp; outs with Houston at 0.116 (all numbers prior to today's games)

Edit: they have worse average starting field position (at their own 29.29 yard line) than the Lions, Titan, Browns, Chiefs, Seahawks, Panthers, Saints, 49ers and Patriots. Worst starting field position is the Cowboys at the 25.39 yard line, Pats have it average at their 33.14.",Ravens,1,1575840210,e7wj9u

We have seen plenty of times where QBs end up with huge passing numbers, crazy yards and most of it is garbage time.  Thats a very common claim and assessment, its logical.    QBs get written off or downgraded for it all the time.    It should work on the other end of the spectrum too, a running QB or a running back is able to pad stats as a front runner due to a defense that keeps opponents with a low score.

I didn’t say it was all on the defense.   But i said they are huge part of his success and why the offensive gameplan works well for him. 

He’s passed for yards, but he gets a lot of 1st read passes created again, by that run game and play action, which again is available in the playbook due to a tight defense.     Even todays 60yd TD was like 50yds YAC, to a wide open WR, its a great play, but thats more a play by the WR than the QB.",Seahawks,1,1575839656,e7wj9u

Are you shitting me? 

Have you ever watched a kneel-down play? 

How often do you see them get blown up? 

When they get blown up, have you ever heard the defensive coach getting criticized? I remember when Schiano got CRUCIFIED for doing it. 

Lining up in that formation says to the defense, ""We're just going to clock it, don't hurt us."" And now the Ravens don't deserve to get that benefit anymore at the end of halves. 

Yes, it was a trick play, but it was a trick play that took advantage of the fact that the Bills weren't trying to attack the offensive line because the Ravens were representing that they were going to clock it.",Bills,0,1575834248,e7wj9u
