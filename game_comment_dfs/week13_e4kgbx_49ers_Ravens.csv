Also, Andrews has just as much right to go up for that ball - Ward mistimed it and got there a split second too early, and knocked both himself and Andrews off balance with an elbow to the neck (which could have been a separate penalty, as there's an argument to be made that Andrews was a defenseless player at the moment) and a hip-check to the middle of his back, meaning Andrews had no chance to make a play on it well before the ball had arrived. 

Had Ward actually timed it properly it would have been a fairly contested ball, and it might have actually given him a better chance to pick it off cleanly, instead of trying to catch it off balance in mid air.",,1,1575246753,e4kgbx

&gt;**Playing through the back of an opponent in an attempt to make a play on the ball**;

&gt;Grabbing an opponent‚Äôs arm(s) in such a manner that restricts his opportunity to catch a pass;

&gt;Cutting off the path of an opponent by making contact with him, without playing the ball;

&gt;Hooking an opponent in an attempt to get to the ball in such a manner that it causes the opponent‚Äôs body to turn prior to the ball arriving; or

&gt;Initiating contact with an opponent by shoving or pushing off, thus creating separation.

I‚Äôve been enjoying the Outer Worlds quite a bit. I have about 25-30 hours in it but I also play these games very slowly and try to over level like crazy. 

I put 300+ hours into fallout 3 and really disliked fallout 4. It‚Äôs not th most complex game but there is a lot of good story and lore in it. Tons of computers you can get on in it and read about people‚Äôs lives, adds a lot of nice atmosphere. It‚Äôs also pretty. 

Some other neat things, weapons and armor can be customized with mods you find and/or buy and you can ‚Äútinker‚Äù with weapons and armor to make them stronger, it costs money but it‚Äôs nice. There are also other fun weapons(like the shrink gun in the commercial) and every companion character has multi level story quests which adds a lot to them other than just being side characters.
