2,"Packers get easy games at opportune times in the season. Always have, always will. They get their tough games at opportune times for them, and inopportune times for their opponents. You can't look up this dynamic.

You've conceded that the refs favor you, so thank you for admitting you're in a lot of trouble without help from the refs. You can't look into how these penalties shaped the game. More often than not these penalties are huge momentum swingers that determine the outcome. A team will be marching, then all the momentum is crushed by a bullshit call that literally can't be defended by anyone but delusional fans. Lions game this year? Explain those 2 non penalties in a row. I could reference tons more games. Not to mention all the non-calls your line is blessed with. The packers are allowed to hold. No casual fan specifically watches the line, so it goes unnoticed. I do, and I notice. I have to turn games off because it's so maddeningly obvious. You can use stats to prove anything, but the eye test shows a whole different story.

You're biased, so you have an inability to see it. Recognize this and your life will be clearer. I'm not really even a big fan of the NFL anymore, I just have major gripes with ignorance and people that are willingly ignorant. The NFL, and specifically packers fans are the epicenter of this delusion and ignorance.

3,"Wow, okay a lot to unpack there. I'm just going to ignore the Ad hominem/personal attacks. Not worth the time. If you actually want to about sports and not just sling silly attacks, I'd be more than happy to oblige; that doesn't seem to be your MO though. 

[The trap card activation is literally just a meme, lol.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-just-activated-my-trap-card)

The two main arguments you're making is that the Packers are a bad team that are only helped along by a weak schedule and favorable calls from the refs, right? Let's break those down for a second. 

Strength of schedule for the Packers vs the Vikings: [2019: 14th vs 10th,](https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/nfl-strength-schedule-rankings-2019-did-patriots-get-gift), [2018: 1st vs 8th](https://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/272281/2018-nfl-strength-of-schedule), [2017: 18th vs 27th](https://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule), [2016: 32nd vs 18th](https://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/201479/2016-nfl-strength-of-schedule), [2015: 13.66th vs 11.66th (average of the three lists in the table linked](https://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/165472/2015-nfl-strength-of-schedule), [2014: 13th vs 21st](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2014-nfl-strength-of-schedule-raiders-at-no-1-colts-at-no-32/), [2013: 6th vs 10th](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2013-nfl-strength-of-schedule-panthers-tough-test-or-is-it/). [2012: 31st vs 8th](https://nflspinzone.com/2012/04/12/nfl-schedule-2012-what-is-your-teams-strength-of-schedule/). This is as far back as I could find SoS metrics while wasting time on this at work, but I think going back to 2012 is fair reasonable here. If we take the average SoS over that time GB averaged 16.08th while the Vikings averaged 14.2th. Have the vikings had harder schedules than the packers over that time period, sure, by the numbers. Is GB being carried to their records by consistently easy schedules? Absolutely not.

As for the penalties. This is a really hard metric to actually apply statistics to. There is a lot of game information that is lost in the box scores for penalties. I'm betting you were a fan of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/e20p14/first_down_by_penalties_on_3rd_down_via/?st=k3ukr6jm&amp;sh=1f5d1112) the other day and how it is such great evidence that the packers are helped out by the refs. By the numbers, yes GB has been ""gifted"" the most 1st downs by penalty on 3rd down over the past 10 seasons. But, lets actually look at those numbers. My eye says GB got 112 first downs by pentaly on 3rd down over those 10 seasons. The league average during that time was around 82. 30 first downs! THATS INSANE THE REFS ARE CLEARLY FAVORING THE PACKERS. Well, hold on. That's over a 10 year span. That means the Packers are getting, on average, 3 more 1 downs via penalty per season than the average NFL team. You might call that ref bias, I would personally say that's the effect of the Rodger's hard count. Without going through the replays of every single penalty over the past 10 years, i can't say definatively that the refs favor the Packers. Are the refs terrible and ruin games because their lack of ability to get a call right? Yeah absolutely. Are the Packers benefited more so than any other team in the league? I haven't been convinced, but you're welcome to try. The Packers have been shafted by the refs just as much as anyone else except maybe the Saints. 

If you actually want to respond to any of this go for it. If you're response is actual analysis and commentary, rather than just hot headed sports bar talk regurgitating Booger and Bayless hot takes, I'll just wish you a happy rest of the season, cuz this was way more work than it was probably worth. Feel free to show me how shit my team is though. If you can actually make some coherent arguments to that effect, I'd be very impressed.",Packers,1,1575662831,e4kggr

And the parameters of the data set were pretty narrow: ""accepted 3rd down penalties that award an automatic first down."" Does the Packers defense get called on those penalties more on 2nd down than other teams? Do the Packers face less 3rd downs on defense because they give up more first downs on earlier downs. Are opposing teams declining the penalties because they are getting the first down despite the penalties? All are valid questions giving the mediocre to bad defenses we've rolled out the last decade.
