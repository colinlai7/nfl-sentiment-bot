Yeah it's annoying. I am pretty sure the refs are working under an unofficial mandate to try and keep certain games closer than they would be naturally. Obviously can't prove it, and I sound like a conspiracy theory, but it happens all the time.

I hate the inconsistent holding calls especially, because it basically gives refs the discretion to call the game. You can't afford NOT to hold a bit to avoid your QB from getting sacked every play, when you get away with it 90% of the time.",Panthers,3,1576444123,eb1qx0
