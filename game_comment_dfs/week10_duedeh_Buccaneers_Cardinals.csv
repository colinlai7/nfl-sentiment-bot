0,You hate America bro????? These brave young people are putting their lives on the line every day for the American War Machine‚Ñ¢ and to protect your freedom from imaginary threats. Show some god damn respect.,Cardinals,1,1573426052,duedeh
1,"No, I actually have quite the unbiased look at the game. I'm a transplant to Arizona, go review both of the DPI plays, you'll see Evans push the defenders to the ground. Ridiculous that they called the second one especially in the defender, since he was clearly incidentally contacting the receiver (regardless of being pushed, and the fact it was a no call on the field), and even more so if you don't think your defender on the last play committed textbook DPI when they explicitly state in the rules that you can't play through the back of a receiver, but what do I know, except the rules?

And to be clear, I'm not saying you guys didn't have a chance at scoring without those calls, but those calls (and lack of) is what gave you the game, and if you can't acknowledge that, then there's no reason to talk to someone who lets bias get in the way of a game that could have otherwise been good.",Cardinals,1,1573426007,duedeh
2,Booooooo,,1,1573424372,duedeh
3,larry the best post season performer ever? oh now i see. you're confusing him for jerry rice.,Buccaneers,1,1573423281,duedeh
4,"He‚Äôs better than Evans in every category, top 3 receiver all time. Best post season performer ever... let me know when Evans even gets there.

‚ÄúWoman beating pos‚Äù just lets me know you don‚Äôt have a clue what you‚Äôre saying. üëã",Cardinals,0,1573422865,duedeh
5,"The way they see it, outside that Lions call, is that its a last ditch desperation throw that's at best 50/50. As long as the defense is making *some* attempt to play the pass, which Dean was even with contact, they'll let it ride.",Buccaneers,1,1573422784,duedeh
6,"The ""face mask"" on the Lions like 3 years ago?  Granted outside of that.....yes you are correct.",Broncos,2,1573422684,duedeh
7,"And the call on VH3 was questionable because he was playing to the ball, as Blandino explained on air. Not to mention, on that last play, the Oline could have drawn a flag on the right side of the line. So many woulda coulda shouldas, but the Cards played the last series terribly.",Buccaneers,1,1573422609,duedeh
8,"There was very little *incidental* contact on the INT between two players looking at and running to the ball. Evans got rolled up on by someone not even able to make a play on the ball. I mean, these things were thoroughly explained by the commentators and Blandino.",Buccaneers,3,1573422505,duedeh
9,Penalty gives them an extra play. You're right. Time out was irrelevant. The missed call gets them a field goal.,,2,1573422466,duedeh
10,You're right. The time out is irrelevant but they get an extra play if they call the obvious PI. You won on a missed call.,,-1,1573422398,duedeh
11,"If the PI on Evans was correct, then Sherfield getting tripped resulting in an INT should have been a PI call as well. My read is neither of them were, but if you want to say they both were, it's still a gift to the Bucs.",Cardinals,-1,1573422292,duedeh
12,fitz couldnt hold mikes jock strap. hate to break it to you but that woman beating pos has no business being mentioned with a legend like mike,Buccaneers,1,1573422189,duedeh
13,"I would say Kingsbury letting like twenty seconds tick off the clock during the final drive directly led to the loss.

If we're going to play the ""refs screwed us"" game, let's not ignore the fact that we ran out of challenges because they kept getting obvious calls wrong, and once we were out of challenges, there was nothing we could do about another incorrect call where Murray should've been ruled down, which robbed Barrett of another sack.",Buccaneers,3,1573421980,duedeh
14,Extra play with defensive penalty...they would have kicked a field goal.,,3,1573421912,duedeh
15,I always forget about the no challenges within 2 minutes,Packers,1,1573421858,duedeh

Sorry about that by the way. Phantom face mask.",Packers,1,1573421832,duedeh
17,Ah - I always forget about that,Packers,1,1573421806,duedeh
18,"The PI on Evans was the correct call, and refs never call PIs on hail marys. That's just how those plays go. I don't know why, but that is consistent league wide.",Buccaneers,2,1573421775,duedeh
19,Unless you‚Äôre GB,Seahawks,3,1573421755,duedeh
20,"The offsides was on the missed field goal in the 3rd quarter, after Gay already missed they randomly threw a flag and called PP offsides, rekicked and made it. That pretty much directly lead to the loss",Cardinals,1,1573421753,duedeh
21,PI would have stopped the clock in FG range.,Seahawks,1,1573421715,duedeh
22,"With zero on the clock? If he does catch it, clock hits 0 anyways because time will run before he's down.",Buccaneers,2,1573421666,duedeh
23,You've got quite the imagination.,Buccaneers,0,1573421653,duedeh
24,"Oh, if we'd played better we'd have been up 20 points. Maxx doesn't drop the easy TD pass, DJ doesn't fumble on the 10, Sherfield doesn't trip and give up the INT... that's 21 points right there. 

But that doesn't change the fact that the booth adding a DPI in the end zone after the Cards had made 3 stops, and then not even reviewing the obvious DPI against the Cards on the final drive, are insanely inconsistent and an obvious gift to the Bucs.",Cardinals,1,1573421644,duedeh
25,Time would've run out by the time he caught it and went down to end the play.,Cowboys,2,1573421612,duedeh
26,"I don't recall the off-sides, but your receiver fell down on the interception, and Evans was blatantly interfered with multiple times. I knew the flags were coming each time.",Buccaneers,1,1573421560,duedeh
27,PI happened on the play before which stopped the clock. The clock was stopped before the play on which the holding took place occurred,Saints,1,1573421473,duedeh
28,They had a time out and all they need is a field goal?,,4,1573421469,duedeh
29,"Mike Evans pushed off twice on your last drive and somehow we got called for DPI on both plays. Literally throws a player to the ground, and that player gets flagged, and then your player performs a textbook DPI of playing through the back of the receiver.   What game were you watching? They literally gifted you the game.  
If they're going to call the Cards for those DPIs, they 100% need to call that one. There's no excuse for it.",Cardinals,0,1573421448,duedeh
30,First you run a delayed draw... then you follow it up with no sense of urgency to huddle.. that loss was deserved.,Vikings,6,1573421444,duedeh
31,Rigged? In favor of... the Bucs? Really?,Buccaneers,-3,1573421437,duedeh
32,"Ah yes, the phantom offsides on PP when you missed a kick, no call on the INT, Mike Evans screaming and getting a call for any small amount of contact. Really fucked over there",Cardinals,2,1573421417,duedeh
33,Really? It wasn't that awful clock management or the oline being swiss cheese?,Buccaneers,-1,1573421411,duedeh
34,It was entertaining at least,Cardinals,1,1573421407,duedeh
35,new to football?,Buccaneers,2,1573421406,duedeh
36,"Yeah that was DPI. But really, if he would've caught that, game is over. If the ball hit the ground, game is over. There were a few defenders around him and it was a jump ball. 0% chance he scores on that play anyway. Being upset that a DPI didn't give you an extra play and the opportunity to tie the game is asinine.",Cowboys,2,1573421406,duedeh
37,What? It was a holding call. The PI happened on a different play,Lions,1,1573421392,duedeh
38,Dumbest thing I‚Äôve seen all day,Saints,0,1573421383,duedeh
39,Yea there was definitely a second left. Refs are fucking grabage,,6,1573421365,duedeh
40,That call would have given us a play in field goal range while down by 3. Pretty clear.,Cardinals,2,1573421363,duedeh
41,Yes it was. It was stopped from the PI,Saints,0,1573421347,duedeh
