13,"My opinion:

Penny was injured at the time of my comment. And now out for the season. The 1st quarter made the game very obvious how it was going to go. Coaches all absolutely refuse to adapt and change their philosophy. Going game after game BARELY winning isn't an improvement. Not to mention, the o-line has only gotten worse, hence Wilson having 5 consecutive games with an interception. Vs the 49ers, they were missing Kittle, Sanders, and 2 other key players yet we BARELY beat them. We can't rely on last second comebacks EVERY game. It's a recipe for failure. The fact we struggle with both good and bad teams, and lose to the good teams unless they have key injuries, shows we're gonna lose in the playoffs. 

This defense is ass, o-line is even worse, playcalling is simple, predictable, and garbage. Defensive play-calling is even worse. You and I both know this team has just had a LOT of luck. Would have 2 more losses if not for opposing teams missing clutch field goals at the end of the game. 

You and I both know this team is going to get stomped by the 49ers and then by any other team with good offense and defense, such as the Ravens. Can't rely on luck and last minute comebacks. Those will only take you so far.",Seahawks,1,1576119415,e82dn6

Why I believe that,is they KEEP making these big comebacks in games to win by 2 points. I can see why that would feel unstable, but I genuinely believe a healthy Seahawks team with that Penny/Carson 1-2 punch can beat any team.
I don‚Äôt think the 49ers will spank them, I think it‚Äôs gonna be another tight well fought game between the two.

They‚Äôre simply the two best teams in the NFC right now. The Rams historically always get at least one game on the Seahawks a a season. This wasn‚Äôt a blowout like that home game in 2017.

Idk man, I just think every team is due for a bad game, and before this the hawks were just getting better week by week. That‚Äôs my opinion",,1,1576118816,e82dn6

Oh, I will. Here‚Äôs a quick reality check for you: what are the odds that the Niners won‚Äôt have the best TE in football on the field, or their best receiver, or their best RB, will commit multiple turnovers, AND miss a game winning FG again?

Because I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware that this is what happened the last time we met...and it still took the Seahawks five quarters to win it. 

Methinks some of you guys are very confident over a game you barely (and that may even be too generous a word) won...fresh off getting your asses beat by a team the Niners stomped no less. 

That‚Äôs, uh...that‚Äôs something. 

&gt; You're going to get beat, just like you did on the way t ok our SB victory (I was there, it was fantastic).

Sure you were. Let me guess, you have also been a fan ‚Äúsince the Largent days‚Äù eh?

When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

Like half of the comments I've seen on this sub are so obviously written by non-athletes that it's almost humorous.

When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

So, yeah. I hope yall can understand why I feel like their's such a big disconnect between myself and your typical redditor. Please tell me I'm not the only one who feels this way lol",Lions,-26,1575863188,e82dn6

Like half of the comments I've seen on this sub are so obviously written by non-athletes that it's almost humorous.

When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

So, yeah. I hope yall can understand why I feel like their's such a big disconnect between myself and your typical redditor. Please tell me I'm not the only one who feels this way lol",Lions,-26,1575862477,e82dn6

Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)
