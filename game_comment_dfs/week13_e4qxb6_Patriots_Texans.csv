15,I didn’t say it was Brady’s fault. It’s not like I’m saying Brady shouldn’t take what the defense gives him. I’m just saying that his stat line looks way better than what it deserved to be.

So as a Pats' fan, I don't want to hear from AB and his tweets make zero impression on me. I believe in character and I believe in decency. As corny as it may sound, I believe in the Patriot way. So I hold out no hope for AB. My only hope now is that the woman he threatened turns out to be a child molestor or a Neo-Nazi or a kicker-of-puppies. Something really bad. Because if that happens then I can look at AB and say ""ya, sure he threatened some lady, but that lady was a puppy-kicking monster"" and then I can feel good when he scores a bunch of touchdowns against the Ravens in the AFC championship. #patriotway",Patriots,1,1575271652,e4qxb6

I'll probably be downvoted by other Pats fans but they performed well against bad teams which they are supposed to do but just don't show up as good against the teams that matter.  Sure, a short field early on didn't help them but they haven't really helped their case the rest of the game either.

They will be one and done in the playoffs unless the offense can be more consistent.  Can't rely on the defense to somehow come up with turnovers against good offenses without being able to put up points more often when the opportunity is there.",Patriots,2,1575259363,e4qxb6

My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

When you die, it’s always your fault, but this game is more forgiving than others because it gives you a free death and resurrection before a “true death.” The story is pretty good. The combat system is perfect. It’s extremely fluid and feels great once you get it down. There isn’t any customization other than a few different special moves you can swap between. If you haven’t played a FromSoft game before, get ready for the most challenging game you’ve ever played and don’t be afraid to look things up because info in the game is sparse and vague. Sekiro is the best about this out of the FromSoft games but it’s still pretty easy to get confused. Definitely my favorite game of the last year and 100% would recommend it.

If you’re neutral the observation of the Pats offense is obvious: the WRs are getting zero separation on the outside, Edelman is doubled, and they don’t have a dynamic RB to soften the front 7 up, so the field is extra shrunk and Brady has very little to work with.

I get it though BrADy iS WaSHeD is way easier to say (for the record I’m not saying he’s still the Brady of old, but it doesn’t really matter how good or bad he is as long as their receiving corps are in this state)",,-3,1575255084,e4qxb6

Thomas Edward Brady has sexual intercourse with the referees before football games. That's why it's the *fuck rule* not the *tuck rule*. Here's a guy, who gets every single call in the history of football that goes his way. Same with his team. They never get called for penalties. Am I supposed to believe this utter nonsense, that the Patriots teach disciplined football? No. That can't possibly be it. Tom Brady sucks the penis of every referee apart of the crew pre game. That's why the balls were deflated, he sucks them dry. I'm sorry to speak the truth.

Unfortunately, during the 1997 NFL offseason, the NFL decided to ban players from removing their helmets on the field, especially during a touchdown celebration.

Although Brett Favre's celebration is the most notable, it is commonly referred to as the ""Emmitt Smith"" rule because of the running back's habit of taking off his helmet after every touchdown.",,1,1575251709,e4qxb6

I'm sitting at my couch watching Sunday night football, and I see the picks for who's gonna win. I don't understand how these people keep blindly picking the Patriots every game. Same with ESPN. Their power rankings still have them number one, which is just simply not true. Don't get me wrong, the Patriots are not bad. Bill Belichick is the goat of coaching. But this is one of the worse pats team I've seen during the dynasty. They apparently had the number one defense, but Baltimore ripped it apart. They still think they are the number one team in the league just because of their record. Who have they beat? Bills, cowboys, eagles, dolphins, browns, Redskins, giants, and the Jets. They're a few wildcard teams sprinkled in their wins, but look at the other teams that are ""worse"" than the pats. Ravens have beat the pats, Rams, 49ers, steelers, cardinals, dolphins, Seahawks, Texans, and probably more that I cannot remember. The Ravens have played better teams, and have almost the exact same record, except for one game. How are the Patriots a more powerful team than the Ravens or 49ers by not playing any competition with a mediocre team? It stuns me that this league and the media are so blind.

Not saying they're going to win, but I would kind of get it (and it would align with my position) if they shut down the Pats completely and walked away with a completely bizarre and unpredictable 14 point win.",Chiefs,3,1575248088,e4qxb6
