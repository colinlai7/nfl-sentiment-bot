Get a #1 Wr to nurture through the draft along with an established #1 WR via free agency. Hopefully we see an improvement in his game similar to Dak this year with those additions.

1083,Ok Boomer,Chiefs,2,1575243088,e4nk6d
1084,I feel like the NFL was trying to deter coaches from challenging every single PI or non PI call but wanted it to be saved for big moments like the end of the season or the playoffs when games really matter. That's the only thing I can think of why they are changing course like this so suddenly. First it was nothing now it's a fair amount being over turned,Packers,3,1575243087,e4nk6d

1090,Yep.  That's the maddening part of it.  There's no consistency at all to any of the calls and enforces the perception that the refs control the game.  It's a complete disaster.,Chiefs,1,1575243082,e4nk6d
