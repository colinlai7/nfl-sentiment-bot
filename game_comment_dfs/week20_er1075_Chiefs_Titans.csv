Hes done nothing to redeem himself and has in fact continued to be a legitimately bad person (I consider threatening the mother of your child a big negative). 

I believe in redemption...for the people that deserve it. Hills done nothing to deserve it.

People should be held responsible and judged according to their actions. Hills actions shows he will beat his pregnant GF and continue to threaten her years later., while showing no remorse and taking no actions (other than court mandated) to improve himself or help others in similar situations. So no, he hasn't shown hes changed, he hasn't earned redemption and as such should be judged for his actions.

The first is to sit down and listen to the full tape where the woman who accused Hill of abuse is secretly recording him - meaning he doesn’t know - and he says multiple times he never abused her and she had no response to that whatsoever. He said, clearly and without equivocation, that he didn’t hit her and prompted her to respond and she did not.

Moreover, regarding the child abuse, he was investigated multiple times and met with CPS multiple times. They had nothing on him to even bring charges much less obtain a conviction. A doctor brought in by the Johnson County DA determined the broken arm was consistent with a fall and a typical greenstick fracture that was not indicative of abuse. Furthermore, the mother admitted to the broken arm being her fault. 

So tell me how you know more about the situation. Tell me how you have better information than I do and a better grasp on the legal process? You wanna talk about how fucked up the plea bargain system is? Let’s talk about how prosecutors overcharge people to strong arm them into a plea deal. Let’s talk about how a black man without a ton of money in a conservative state is fucked because not only will they not get adequate legal counsel, they will also not get a fair trial amongst a bunch of pearl-clutchers. So, please, tell me about how you’re more well-versed on this matter and in this field than me. Go ahead. I’m listening.

This isnt a 15 year old kid stealing a DVD. This was an adult attacking his gf and unborn child. You dont get a pass just because it was a few years ago. 

To make it worse he says ""“You should be afraid of me"" to thus same woman **3 years later** threatening her.

Yup I judge folks based on their actions. Crazy right?  How insane to think people dont get a magical pass because they are athletic. 

So yea if you attack and abuse someone you SHOULD be judged. That isnt an accident, you did that on purpose and as such you should be judged on what you have done.

20464,"Humor me for a second on this quick analysis.

Mahomes pulled some Lamar Jackson bullshit on that play.  I don't say that because he took off running and spinning, but because he baited that second missed tackle at the line of scrimmage.  He knew he wasn't going to pass it, but he let up, forcing the defender to take the opportunity and push him out, but then shook him and ran.

I thought he was getting sacked right there, and was so dumbfounded how he didn't see that guy coming and get rid of the ball.  He did see him coming, and he baited him into missing.  Just that slight stagger was all he needed to break the edge.  

Not to mention he runs to the corner, with the Titans collapsing over to bounds him, but he chooses to cut inside.  Anyone blasting the Titans for not tackling him don't realize Mahomes *never* cuts inside there, he always slides, so they let up not to dome him expecting the slide.  Good mind games from Mahomes.

No one shoots it and people keep talking about how every tens must shoot threes and go to the rim. Look at Houston they suck in the playoffs every year with that style.


 With the NFL the innovative offensive schemes get overrated like three point shots. The game is different today with a bit more athletic players and defensive players. You need to have athletic teams and QBs, but that doesn’t mean you can’t run the ball old school or just do the old school run the ball two times and pass on third down if it’s a third and long. It’s like in soccer if you can pack the goal for the whole game you will always make the game close and hope for a counter attack for a goal.

35833,"&gt;Racist contempt is not restricted to team names. It can also be seen in such “rituals” as the “tomahawk chop” or demeaning dances, or the offensive use of feathers, face painting, drums, and war whoops. Ethnic slurs that would be unthinkable if directed at other groups are sometimes defended as a way to “honor” our Indian heritage. Many non-Indians seem oblivious to the insidious impact of such offensive practices. They help perpetuate inaccurate stereotypes about Native American cultures. They demean Native American peoples' sacred objects, ceremonial traditions, and components of traditional dress. They mock Native American religious practices.
