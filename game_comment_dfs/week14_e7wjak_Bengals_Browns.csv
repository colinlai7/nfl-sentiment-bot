5,Let’s talk about that interception where the guy pulled the ball out after he was down and then they review it and somehow he’s not just ruled down?,,1,1575848861,e7wjak
6,Freddie was on the staff last year Taylor was a low ranking coordinator on another team,Browns,1,1575840897,e7wjak
7,He'll probably trade the pick for John Gruden or some shit,Bengals,1,1575840684,e7wjak
8,No but I'm not paid millions to practice/be good at football which obviously many of the players on the Browns failed at especially during the off season.,Browns,1,1575840369,e7wjak
9,"Why? They're good but they're not other worldly good like people are making them out to be. We still have a long shot at playoff contention and we've hung with every team we've played with the exceptions of the Titans and 49ers games. Even against the Patriots, we destroyed them statistically if not for the catastrophic sequence of 3 straight turnovers. Despite what the narrative says, there isn't that much difference between the top and bottom teams which is why we say any given Sunday.",,1,1575840310,e7wjak
10,"Personally, I'm not thinking hes been great but I think it would be a HUGE mistake to move on from him. He does some things that make me smh but he also does some things I really like. The team has looked better as the year has gone on, the players seem to really like him, and he has a solid history of developing QB's for if we go Burrow in the draft. I really think he has potential to a really good coach given some patience.",Bengals,1,1575840283,e7wjak

19,I don't think he's bad. Gameplan was a bit sketchy here and there but overall he had to play desperation ball for most of it. Good calls to finish out the game. Down 11 with a minute and some change and I was still nervous,Browns,1,1575839970,e7wjak
20,Dude was sub .500 winning percentage and he's doing a million commercials like he's Joe Montana. Hopefully he gets humbled by this season and focuses on what he's paid to do.,Browns,1,1575839960,e7wjak
21,I don't know how we were in any position to win this game with our trash playcalling and the calls that went against us. The Browns really need to fire Kitchens.
