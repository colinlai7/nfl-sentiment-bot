After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a rookie, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last practice. I'm trying to explain that I'm a QB who wishes to live a very quiet life.

9583,"&gt;It's often said that depression results from a chemical imbalance, but that figure of speech doesn't capture how complex the disease is. Research suggests that depression doesn't spring from simply having too much or too little of certain brain chemicals. Rather, there are many possible causes of depression, including faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, and medical problems. It's believed that several of these forces interact to bring on depression.

&gt;To be sure, chemicals are involved in this process, but it is not a simple matter of one chemical being too low and another too high. Rather, many chemicals are involved, working both inside and outside nerve cells. There are millions, even billions, of chemical reactions that make up the dynamic system that is responsible for your mood, perceptions, and how you experience life.

I said fuck them for the Cardinals SB loss to the Stealers, and for the Seahawks loss, both of which were majorly influenced by shitty officiating (Arizona they kept a drive alive for a non-existent DPI that nobody seems to remember, Seahawks got clearly fucked on the roughing the kicker call), neither of those teams would I say I'm a fan of.
