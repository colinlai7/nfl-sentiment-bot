Sure, Im not sitting around thinking ""god I wish that dude would die already!"". 

but Im not give one fuck if they do. Because every NFL owner is old-ass money from old-ass money families. And when you are in that position and continue to be in that position, it's because you are willing to take steps that unethical and almost always immoral.
