4,"Yeah, you're correct on that one. I was referring to the down count one. 

Let's call it a draw ;)",Patriots,1,1573438483,dueddw
5,Still would have been 3rd down and not 4th if it was a delay of game. I thought you meant the offsides/false start one,Giants,1,1573432189,dueddw
6,No. You're wrong. I just checked and it was 3rd and 10 and Jets got a dpi on that call. This was the one where they snapped the ball after play clock hit 0 and 1 more sec w elapsed,Patriots,1,1573431608,dueddw
7,Looks like it did follow the script,Patriots,1,1573430047,dueddw
8,Seems good to me so far. How did you enjoy seeing your high 1st rounder RB put up one yard on the ground?,Cowboys,1,1573425158,dueddw
9,yeah it's awesome that John Mara's first two head coach hires have been McAdoo and Shurmur. Gives me hope for the next one!,Giants,3,1573420838,dueddw

18,I loved that we fired a lame duck coach who had no idea what he was doing just to replace him with a lame duck coach who has no idea what he's doing. That's a good way to move a team forward.,Giants,5,1573420617,dueddw
19,was that the super bowl?   are we the champions now?,Jets,7,1573420613,dueddw
20,"Taking a 4 or 5 yard completion to set up a still-possible 4th and 10 is better than trying to thread into double coverage, forcing you to punt because it's now 4th and 15+.

51,O line is kill and Saquon hasn’t been 100%. Plus all shurmur does is run up the middle.,Giants,3,1573420199,dueddw

He's given up a lot of capital to bring in veterans and the returns are bad. He makes a bunch of lateral moves and lacks a plan, I've seen enough to draw conclusions on him

This team has a bottom three roster and DG is trading away draft picks like they are in contention... He has an eye for talent but I haven't seen anything resembling a plan since he's got to NY. He's added a bunch of defensive linemen yet the Giants get gashed on the ground and can't rush the passer. He's drafted and traded for multiple defensive backs and suddenly the Jets historically bad offense puts up 30.

Now, bc it's happening multiple times it could be that the TV clock actually is off since Fox has had an *extremely* poor year TV wise when it comes to the clock, score, player names, etc - basically every game they've shown has some mess ups with what they show on screen.

He’d make Tom Brady look like Geno Smith. He’d make Baker Mayfield look like a Cleveland Brown. He’d make Dak Prescott look like Dak Prescott. He would reign terror upon the whole league for decades upon decades. He would be dropping dimes on cornerbacks at age 70. It would never end. The league would die if they knew just how great Daniel Jones is and everyone knows it. Goddell and Jerry keep him under wraps. Dave Gettleman saw Jones during the senior bowl and instantly he knew how good he is. Only Gettlegod with his 0/20 vision can see how good this man is. Do not sleep on Daniel Jones.
