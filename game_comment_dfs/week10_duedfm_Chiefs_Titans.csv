The league average for points allowed, at least a couple weeks ago, is 24 points. The Chiefs gave up more points that the league average today. They should expect to lose.

They gave up those points to a backup QB on a 4-5 team. 

They gave up those points by allowing a RB to have almost 200 yards on the ground.

Football has always been a violent game, and it's supposed to be rough. The only steadfast rule I can say I would support is regarding hits to the head. I'd love to see brutal hits come back, even against 'defenseless' receivers so long as they aren't absolutely head-hunted. We can debate that, and I'm not a medical professional so I might be saying something stupid, so I'd definitely concede if I'm off base. But then you have stuff like body weight on the quarterback and all that, which I think is just silly. Or the banning of wedge blocks like it said in the ad. I just don't think it should be illegal to absolutely flatten somebody.
