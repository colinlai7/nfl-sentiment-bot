He’s never made the pro bowl in his career and I would take almost all current #1 receivers over him.  He’s only had one 1000 yard season in his entire career.

You can tell Mahomes is getting very bored though. He wants to sling it, and I admire his resolve to actually play smart and safe despite having the talent and mindset to go for 400+ yards and 5 TDs. The Chargers have a good defense to pair against our team. They can rush 4 and get to the QB quick while running 5+ DBs. Their biggest weakness is the run, which we should have exploited more. It annoys me how little we use Sherman. Put him in the backfield and have him lead the way for the RB.",,1,1574169914,dycm4i

78,"How do you quantify ascending to that level?  By being the best for a year?  Because Ben has never done that.

I will admit Brees has been the best for a year, same for Rodgers, Manning and obviously Brady,  But other than that, since he's played the other years have had multiple guys in the mix and he's been one of them in his prime.

Eli has 2 rings and he's never been close to being the best for a year and some people here actually think he's way better than Rivers.

Honestly as a long time Chargers fan, i'll give you my assessment.  We're cursed.  He's easily my favorite player of all time but he has to go because we can't start a new era and hope to ditch the curse with the main guy who's been through all those bad games still here lol.

I just feel bad for the dude, he should have at least one ring by now and fan reactions would instantly be different which is stupid because why should some ring years ago impact how people judge you now?  In our 2006 choke vs the Patriots it wasn't his fault, our pro bowl kicker misses like a 39 yarder at the end, and Marlon McCree a veteren from the Panthers Superbowl team (2004) decides to try to return an int from Brady with minutes left in the game and an 8 point lead and fumlbes.  I'll stop there, i'm sure you know all the history and the stupid chokes so I won't rant to you about that or make excuses.

But my point is dude is just cursed/unlucky.  He was definitely as good as those guys like Brady Rodgers Manning Brees etc to win a ring but for whatever reason he and his teams that had a shot back in the mid to late 2000's decided to have epic choke jobs and now its too late to recover.

I think dude is legit impacted by those choke jobs mentally and it haunts him.  As opposed to someone like Brady who made the most of it early and tasted a lot of success.

Oh well, he had a good run I think the dude should retire too and just take care of his 9 kids lol.  San Diego will never taste a championship unfortunately.

November the 18th Year of Our Lord 2019

&amp;nbsp;

Dear Wife,

&amp;nbsp;

I arrived here last night at 5 o'clock. The Chiefs with others had been ordered from Kansas City to this place and I learned at Estadio Azteca they were here.

&amp;nbsp;

The air is too thin, vapors most. We fight in the sky, near'r to God than I have ever been. The sick and convalescent, those unfit for duty numbering about 50 men were left in the tunnel. Reid's army has been moved during the last few plays. The team is there without tents or baggage and the second half is expected everyday. As soon as I can find positively where my offensive line is, it will be necessary for me to go to it and shall dos o tomorrow, taking my helmet only.

&amp;nbsp;

Give Halle, Caroline, Grace, Gunner, Sarah, Peter, Rebecca, Clare, and any others you may'v had whilst I have been serving General Lynn.

&amp;nbsp;

No more at present from your truly husband

&amp;nbsp;

""You've taken everything from me, Mahomes,"" Rivers thinks. 

Rivers takes the snap, drops back into the pocket. His fading eyes squint downfield as he sees the only open receiver who's somehow broken free of Kansas City's elite defense. 

""You haven't beaten me yet, Mahomes,"" thinks the old man. ""Here I come, Hall of Fame."" With the last of the fading strength in his desecrated body, Rivers heaves the ball into the air shotput-style in a desperate Hail Mary, wobbling clumsily towards the end zone. Both of Rivers' knees simultaneously explode into dust. All thirty of his children gasp in horror from the sidelines. As time runs out, the ball lands safely in powder blue gloves. Touchdown.
