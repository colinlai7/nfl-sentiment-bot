67,"False.  The Patriots player lowered the helmet at the point of contact.

Here is the rule:  ""it is a foul if a player lowers his head to initiate 
and make contact with his helmet against an opponent. Contact does not have to be to an 
opponent’s head or neck area – lowering the head and initiating contact to an opponent’s torso, 
hips, and lower body, is also a foul. Violations of the rule will be easier to see and officiate when 
they occur in open space – as opposed to close line play – but this rule applies anywhere on the 
field at any time.""",Eagles,1,1574039111,dxsewi

1442,"&gt;Edelman started talking trash to whatever teammate came over who got in his face and was calling for a flag.

You literally have no evidence as to what was being said.

&gt;He was shaken up on the play, but why should you care? It wasn't your team's player. SMDH

Players get ""shaken up"" all the time. It's a physical sport. He's not injured.

&gt;you only perpetuate the stigma of the Patriots shitty fanbase because you think your team is infallible.

I never said we were infallible. I said you were overreacting in typical r/NFL fashion. Both players were going for the ball. Edelmen thought he had the ball, he tried to strip the nonexistant ball (as you can see with Edelman's arms moving in a swatting motion.) Rough play, luckily nobody was seriously hurt.

&gt;It has nothing to do with speed, nor the time, but Edelman's intent.

1672,"No, you can't read. 

\#1, Edelman committed OPI, as he played through the back of an opponent, which is explicitly stated in the rules, and should have been flagged.  

\#2, He grabbed the guy **AFTER THEY HIT THE GROUND** by the neck. They were not fighting for the ball anymore. It has nothing to do with speed, nor the time, but Edelman's intent. Edelman has no business grabbing the neck/chin area of an opponent. It's dirty and a penalty, and his teammates knew it as well, which is why they ran up right away, and Edelman started talking trash to whatever teammate came over who got in his face and was calling for a flag.

Weird that he did that when he didn't see the replay though, guess he must be some sort clairvoyant who got to see the replay in the future or something, huh?

And looked to me like the defender didn't come out of it fine. He was shaken up on the play, but why should you care? It wasn't your team's player. SMDH
