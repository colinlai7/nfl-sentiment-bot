The whole game would have unfurled differently so it's kind of a moot point, but you clearly only got in fg range at the end because the Packers were playing soft prevent defense 20 seconds left and were happy to allow everything underneath.

The bottom line is that you were robbed of a turnover in an eight point game and that sucks, but it's not accurate to say the refs robbed you of a clear win, because it takes several leaps of faith (would the Bears have converted a 2 point conversion to tie? If they did, would they have won in overtime anyway?

I said I want a chart that specifically measures blown calls because the one you provided only shows that the packers have a disciplined defense and get calls on offense.

You have no statistical proof to say the latter happens more often than the former, instead turning to subjective anecdotes of a few blown calls.

I get the frustration, I do. I also get why other fans are tired of hearing about it.

Which makes sense since he is still inexperienced in reading defenses (he still does an okay job most times). But what people take for granted is that this offense Nagy has designed needs a tight end that is reliable to function well. Mitch has also been playing better due to having bigger targets at wideout. I love Taylor Gabriel’s speed but his catch radius is that of a middle school girl. Also works better when the o-line can actually make a running attack viable which has not happened this year.,Bears,1,1576437048,eb1qzc

A better QB could execute a lot of the plays, but a better HC would keep tailoring the offense to his QB.


Trubisky's problem is that he is inexperienced (ain't good at reading defense, etc), and the same thing can be said for Nagy (having the Bears play against the Raiders while jet lagged, deciding that Trubisky didn't need playing time in the preseason).



TL;DR Nagy's system can work with a better quarterback, but he's not adjusting for the one he has.
