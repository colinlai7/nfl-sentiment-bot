I exaggerate, but I think you're underestimating how the circumstances of the play actually make it easier, especially for a mobile quarterback with a big arm who can buy 6+ seconds to A) Draw defensive holding, B) Draw PI, C) throw accurate bombs after an extended scramble.

497,"Yeah I am forever grateful with how things turned out. I do think that Josh Rosen has been screwed by how his NFL career worked out but part of me also thinks that is karma for his attitude towards the draft (I seem to remember him subtlety putting down the chance that Buffalo drafted him). He probably wouldn't have ended up doing good here anyway.

 I don't know if you were familiar with the Bills playoff game against the Jaguars two years ago, but there was a point where the Bills got to the goal line, Tyrod couldn't get it in so they ended up getting pushed way  back and settled for a field goal. I think that was the point that the new GM and coaching staff decided that they wanted to draft a QB like Cam Newton who could force the ball in for a touchdown on his own. Josh has done that so many times over his short 2 years of playing in the NFL.

Anyway, since the game is over and there is time before the prime time game tonight, you gotta read this post in r/buffalobills from right after the draft. This is the moment when the fan base accepted and began to love Josh ""Fucks"" Allen.

As for the teaser, the lines for the Cowboys was -6.5 and I think the Saints was -7.5. The teaser is like a parlay, that to win you have to win both bets, but the winnings are heavily increased compared to betting each separately. A teaser lowers the threshold you need by the amount of teased points, so a 6 pt teaser lowers the Cowboys -6.5 to them only having to win by -0.5, (essentially winning by one or more, a tie would lose) and the Saints from - 7.5 to - 1.5. it's far more attractive, but also gives you much lower winnings.",Jaguars,2,1574988492,e347mw

Last fucking thing I want to see is Russell Wilson pulling a 4th and 15 out of his ass on every single ""onside play"" and the Seahawks making comebacks from 5 scores down because they never have to give up the ball, because you know he would. 

What's good about onside kicks (or was) was the creativity and finding a way to get the ball back with some of your less prominent players. Not putting yet another fucking play on the quarterback in this already-quarterback-centric league

Bonus: How many ""onside plays"" are going to decide games on a PI call? All of them. That's how many. Because every bad quarterback is going to drop back 30 yards and chuck it 50 and pray, and then the coaches will challenge, and the ref will see someone TOUCHING someone. And the climax of the game will be watching refs dink around with headsets for 10 minutes.

Yes these are great defenses. But Jerry has given this offense everything a QB could ask for. The offensive line is the best in the league. Elliot is a top 5 back. They traded a 1st to get him a top tier WR and signed Cobb. All this wasn't so Dak could carve up the Giants or Redskins. It was to put up points against the exact defenses it's laid eggs against.

Dak is looking for Luck/Wilson money, but you need to score against the better defenses in the league to be worth that money.

Then look at the NFC South (Brees, MRyan, Newton). NFC West sent a team last year to SB, but has 2 other top teams this year. You see what I‚Äôm getting at? AFC has only like 3 QBs in the past 10 years in the superbowl. It would seem another AFC East team could at least get to the playoffs more consistently but they don‚Äôt.

Look at every division including yours - NYGiants and Redskins are two crap teams. It is usually Cowboys and Eagles with Giants now and then. Eli was a shit QB who had 2 really good year endings (that got him SBs despite being wildcards and generally not stellar those years too) but you have Danny Fumbles now and they're still shit.
