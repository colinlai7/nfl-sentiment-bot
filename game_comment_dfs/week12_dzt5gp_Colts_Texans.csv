1594,"I've been a big Peter North fan ever since I saw one of my first pornos that starred Peter North and Jenna Jameson from the 1995 movie Priceless. I didn't know who Peter North was at the time but I did know Jenna Jameson. In this brief scene that was not even 30 seconds long, Peter North bones Jenna doggy-style on the floor and then tit fucks her and cums all over her perfect silicone breasts that were probably in the best shape they were ever in back at that time. You might think that this was the scene that made my 15 year-old self fall madly in love with the talents of Ms. Jameson but you would be wrong to assume that because it was Peter North's talents that I was drawn to more. Amazingly, Peter was in another scene from the same film and I coincidentally downloaded both of these scenes off of Limewire and I didn't have a clue that they were from the same movie until years later. The second scene was Peter and Holly Body and it quickly became my favorite porn scene of all-time within a few weeks after discovering Peter's scene with Jenna from the same movie. Peter plays a private eye who bones a hooker (Holly) in his office and then blasts her large, perfect silicone tits with that otherworldly giant penis of his that shoots bigger ropes and sperm blasts than anyone has ever seen before on film and possibly since. After seeing both of those scenes from 1995 and what was surely his prime, I became one of the biggest Peter North fans around and I would consider myself a Peter North connoisseur and expert.

Peter North's real name is Alden Brown and he grew up in Nova Scotia before relocating to California by the 80s. From what I've gathered, he had a bad cocaine habit and was borderline homeless at times and turned to porn to feed his habit and to settle drug debts that he had racked up. Now, North himself claims that he was ""discovered"" by a guy in the biz while North was modeling sportswear at some party where the guy was admiring his physique and later offered North work in porn. Others like mobster and adult film producer Kenny Gallo claim that North actually got his start in gay porn and that he has tried to hide his homosexual and secret life from everyone and Gallo's claims pass the scrutiny test because anyone with an internet connection can look up photos and videos from North's gay porn films that he starred in. Gallo claims that North became very angry and embarrassed whenever anyone so much as mentioned that he might have appeared in gay porn. North still will not admit that he was in gay porn even though there is undeniable proof of it in the internet and digital age, something which North didn't see cumming in the 80s when he shot these movies. Now let's get back to the straight porn that made me a major North fan...

Peter North, simply put, is the greatest male porn star of all-time. He has a nearly 10 inch penis that -- according to some porn babes he has fucked, including Jenna Jameson -- is about as round as a can of Coke. He is able to shoot loads like few men can and rumor or myth has it that he likes to chomp on celery sticks before a big scene and that the celery is what is responsible for his massive cum blasts that are his absolute trademark. When I was just starting out as a young porn-addicted teen, I kept coming across so many scenes with the hottest porn babes that featured Peter North and so it seemed almost impossible for me to avoid the guy if I wanted to see the hottest girls go at it with a guy. He simply nailed about 95% of all of the hottest porn stars in their primes for three decades and so he is basically like porn's Iron Man and Cal Ripken, Jr.

A few years ago I was feeling a bit down in the dumps because I had seen so many of his scenes and was having a bit of trouble finding some of his other material. At some point I found a vintage porn forum that had nearly every available scene of his and it was like hitting the mother load and an amazing find. For nearly a decade posters have been posting more and more of his scenes and only recently as little as a month ago did it seem to slow down and that there might not be any more of his scenes left to post. I have seen at least half of his scenes now and there are over a thousand of them that he has shot.

In North's last days and years, he was a shadow of his former self. It is obvious to anyone who has seen those scenes of his that his body has been ravished by steroid and cocaine use that has gone on for no less than two decades and that his most valuable and important body part -- his penis -- is past its best. Rumor has it that North actually went to some place like Thailand to have his own skin grafted onto his shriveling and washed-up penis to keep it barely functioning and it is obvious that the look of his peen changed no later than 2010 when he was still going at 57 years-old. His dick looked enlarged and like a chode and his cumshots were nowhere near as powerful or as big, all while he donned dark black wigs (he refuses to admit that he is bald) and gross, leathery skin that has decayed from abusing his body for decades.

Peter North never struck anyone as a smart man. If you watch the few interviews that he has out there, he struggles to string sentences together and he seems to be a bit slow. North has been little more in his perverted, sad, deranged, degenerate life than a drug addict, a creep, a borderline criminal, and a male prostitute who will never come out of the closet. He is now apparently married to a fellow adult film star and together they have a young son. I can't imagine the life that this kid is in for when he finds out that both his mother and father have innumerable photos and videos of them engaging in sex acts for all the world to see on the internet. North has his own social media accounts that seem to be populated by bottom feeders like himself. In North's case, he is/was a literal bottom feeder and you can find evidence of this on the internet.

It would be amazing if someone made a movie about the guy's life since he is the most well-known and accomplished male porn star of all-time. Sure, it might look a lot like Boogie Nights but North's life seems too interesting and morbidly fascinating for even Hollywood to pass up. He is basically like some terrible anti-hero who for most of his time in porn thought of himself as a legitimate star, despite the fact that his greatest talent is ejaculating on the faces and bodies of mostly-troubled young girls whom he and others had a habit of taking advantage of (One girl recounted the time when she was supposed to shoot two anal scenes in a day with North being one of her partners. She was so sore from the first scene that she couldn't shoot with North so North had a cab drop her off at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere with a few bucks and North then turned his phone off, leaving her stranded.)

Despite all of that, North is pretty much the one porn star whom I have paid way too much attention to and that includes the girls. My addiction has been so bad through the years that I even have some of his lines memorized and I can still hear some of the porn music in my head randomly some days and can match it to certain scenes or movies that he has been in. Some people (like myself) can recite lines from classics like Goodfellas or American Psycho verbatim and know the movies front to back and other people (like myself and few others) can recite lines from North movies verbatim and go to great lengths to fill terabytes of external hard drives up with as much of North's porn catalog as humanly or technologically possible.

This past year I found my very first porn scene involving North that I downloaded way back in I think 2006. It was a scene of North and Sunset Thomas where Peter fucks her in some sort of outdoor art room filled with easels and paint brushes and smocks. It took me years to find it and when I did, I channeled my inner horny teenager and turned the lights down low, poured myself a glass of red wine, hooked my PC screen up to my 55 inch TV and enjoyed a cumblast from the past.",Seahawks,1,1574395426,dzt5gp

Also, WAR is position agnostic, from what I can tell. As in, regardless of position, a higher WAR is going to be more valuable. That’s because WAR favors positions which are generally weaker hitting. If you’re a good hitter as a catcher, then you’re way more valuable than someone who is an equally good hitter as an outfielder. Therefore, the catcher will have a higher WAR.

who is the girl host on the amazon prime pre-game show with chris long (to be honest, also bae)?
