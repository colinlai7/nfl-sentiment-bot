25,"Kirk will always bungle things in big situations. People making excuses for him sound just like Skins fans from a couple years ago. 

He played a good a game. His team didn’t help him out much. But at the end of the day he had a golden opportunity with 4:00 down 4 in good field position and couldn’t even manage a single first down.

Kirk can play well and put up good numbers and lead a winning team. However the hump that we have all yet to see him get over is the one he failed to surmount once again tonight.

In pressure situations against good teams he falters with extreme consistency. Tonight was yet another example of that regardless of what led them to that final drive. 

When it comes down to a play or two Kirk is not the guy you want slinging it. 

Doesn’t matter how they end up seeded Vikings won’t ever win more than a wild card game with Kirk at the helm.",Redskins,1,1575405154,e58p5d

And Lol @ your champ banner, yeah you're right but really should've had at least 5-6 championships with the GOAT luckily falling in your laps (but also left you TWICE!!!! to pursue better teams/cities) Keep reliving that championship because it'll be a LONG time before the Browns Cavs or Indians win another lmao",Ravens,1,1575385903,e58p5d

Dalvin Cook had 9 carries for 29 yards, his 9th being the fumble in the 3rd quarter.

Mattison had 4 carries for 22 yards.

Diggs had 4 catches on 9 targets. Only one or two of those were uncatchable.

Thielen is still out and after Diggs and Rudolph (who has to block) his receiving talent falls off a cliff.

Fact is that our defense let up 37 points on the road, Cook got hurt, Thielen is still hurt, and Diggs had bad hands tonight. At what point is Kirk the one being let down instead of him letting us down? Dude threw for 276 and 2 TDs with a bullshit fluke INT. He went out and played really well and all night we lost against the run and when we finally needed the D to make one stand they blow it. Then we don't even get a hail mary attempt.

Regardless, my opinion is that in a close game (like this one) field position is super important and if you have a clear cut chance to punt from the 29 instead of the 9, by using one of your 2 challenges, then I think you have to take it.

secures control of the ball in his hands or arms prior to the ball touching the ground; and
touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and

Diggs had a crucial fumble against Chicago on one of our only productive drives.

Diggs had a fumble against Washington on the first drive that stopped us from setting a tone early. 

He has also had some bad drops, including late against Detroit.

In the pros, no one is actually open. When there's actually an open man, it's because there was a genuine blown coverage.

The eagles blocked him pretty well as he had no sacks but he had two key stops on run plays and we still had 2 or 3 other sacks and got two picks and only let them score 16 points. The blame falls on the offense stalling deep in Philly territory and on Parkey,Bears,1,1575343451,e58p5d

I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Kirk Cousins. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he cuts wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Kirk. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.",Ravens,1,1575341486,e58p5d

22377,"I’ve watched almost every ravens game because the media is so far up Jackson’s ass. His throwing has gotten better form last year but it’s not good yet. His running is good. Ingram helps him A LOT. It’s a very Zeke and Dak type relationship. Without Ingram Jackson would be half the QB we see. And Ingram helps get into the red zone and then Harbaugh draws up plays so Jackson can throw short TDs because he doesn’t make reads well down the field. That’s why he has such low passing yards with such high passing TDs. 

These last 2 games he’s accounted for 200-300 total yards in both of them. Not wildly impressive. Definitely not MVP stats. A few years ago Brees threw for 500 yards in like 5 straight games when he won MVP. That shit is what makes an MVP.

I’m not discrediting him for being more fun to watch. I’m discrediting you for only using the excuse that he’s more fun to watch. It holds absolutely no value in MVP voting. If that’s the bar for MVP voting then C Mac is the run away MVP because he’s the most fun to watch.

And if we’re going off stats he only has 1 impressive statistic out of the ten or so statistics that matter.

And if we’re talking about value to team then he loses as well because he’s surrounded by talent. RB, O line, and receivers. 

Like I said, he’s a great player, but he’s not the best QB in the league. And I can’t justify voting a QB as MVP when he isn’t even the best player at his position.",Raiders,1,1575340737,e58p5d

FedEx and UPS are private companies but assuming you’re talking about the USPS, it functions like a not-for-profit business. USPS postage is regulated by the Postal Regulatory Commission and I imagine the additional services they provide like tracking and expedited shipping are just used to boost revenue stream strictly to pay the employees they need to function operationally. The postal service actually has a legal operation to exist as written in the constitution. The money they charge is a necessity because unfortunately email and the internet hasn’t completely eliminated the need for working postal carriers to deliver mail - not to mention all the clerks, warehouse workers, transit drivers, and logistical departments involved in the process and of course, management needed to oversee the operations at each level. 

Going further, the idea of forever stamps has always seemed similar to the concept of bonds sold by the US during the WW’s in that you purchase them from the government (indirectly in most cases) and they increase in value over time, granted on a exponentially smaller scale. Totally irrelevant to your question, but I always found that interesting.

And if we’re ignoring stats then it’s Russ as well. He has willed the Seahawks to a9-2 record. They don’t have Ingram in the backfield. Or much of anything in defense. Or anything of an O line like Ravens have. 7th best compared the 16 for the Seahawks.

Senior year I led my team to state only to get fucked over by my ankles in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

Like half of the comments I've seen on this sub are so obviously written by non-athletes that it's almost humorous.

When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity football team) I would get a full-on sprint going and clock the shit outta whoever had the ball. My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

Real ones remember when Derrick Thomas logged a record breaking amount of sacks against Dave Krieg and they were undisputed lousy traschcans for the near entirety of their franchises existence in the AFC Best - profootballreference and google are your friends lmfao

Really miss having an objective whipping boy in the AFC West. Everyone in our division is a challenge even if they're struggling for the set up long term.

I'd say ownership grew scared by being beat on ruthlessly by everyone in the division once but glad to see they're just okay in 2019.

- Chiefs (the best offense in the NFL) vs. Patriots (who are still looking for an offense) next Sunday. Should be amusing. Stay tuned folks.
- Pats by every metric lost last night outside of every narrative/ ""ref ball"" excuse whatsoever. They got SHELLACKED by a team that is usually on the receiving end of that in their bizarre/all over the place/cray ass selves.
