0,"&gt; Or I just use that phrase for all people regardless of age, but be mad more lol

once again, calling someone mad doesn't make it so sweetheart.  

&gt;Also are you going to even meet your owen stated acceptable burden of proof seeing how you asked for stats.

Fuck you're dumb.  Like, a diet of lead paint dumb.

&gt;I love how you cant even support your own side with the leve of proof you asked for. You didnt think this one through too well did you?

But neither can you, I specifically pointed it out before I said it.  

Adams had 11 targets.  Rodgers threw 33 times.  1/3 of throwing targets for a WR1 is hardly forcing the ball.

Once again, fuck you're stupid.",Packers,1,1572907869,dr6kr8

Methinks you might be the dumb one here.

Lol stay mad, kid.",Packers,1,1572900358,dr6kr8
2,"&gt; Lol you're in over your head kid.

How so?  And trying to knock someone for their age is a sure sign you're losing the argument. 

Ok, let's throw some more subjective observations at this.  

1. They put actual CBs as a spy on Jones, not a LB, so he wasn't open nearly as much as he has been.

2. You act like it's force feeding someone the ball when a QB goes to their surest target when the line is letting people through like a turnstile.  

3.  What reads?  He barley had time to throw, and when he did, it was a huge bomb downfield, and not to Adams, at all.

I mean, fuck you're dumb.",Packers,1,1572897324,dr6kr8
3,"Lol you're in over your head kid.  

I made a subjective claim based upon my observations of the type of throws made to Adams and the frequency of targets to adams and the other receivers.  Most notably a lack of Jones being utilized as a receiver out of the backfield.  In my subjective opinion the return of Adams had a negative effect on the decision making of Rodgers with respect to his reads caused by Rodgers attempting to force the ball to Adams.  It felt like a step backwards for this offense.  

You on the other hand have claimed I am wrong and have yet to provide any support for your side of the argument outside of whining about burden of proof.  So can you please explain how you came to your decision that I was wrong?  Or are you just gonna whine more cause ""u mad""?",Packers,1,1572896403,dr6kr8
4,"You explained how you came to it by giving me a subjective analysis like it was objective fact.  You proved nothing and furthermore, you cant even understand a basic level of supporting a side of an argument.",Packers,1,1572895184,dr6kr8

Cool.",Packers,1,1572871133,dr6kr8
11,"Well 1 you are mad and 2 I'm not going to waste time doing an in depth statistical analysis on what is an eyeball test conclusion.  

There were numerous throws which looked super forced to Adams where in the past it may have gone to jones in the flat or he may have scrambled more.  Granted the o-line seemed sluggish but it appeared in the moment that rodgers was trying to force the ball to Adams in less than ideal situations.",Packers,1,1572870724,dr6kr8
