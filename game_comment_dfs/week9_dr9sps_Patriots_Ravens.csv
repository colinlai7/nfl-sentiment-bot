3,"Don't get me wrong, the guy is amazing, but a lot of those plays and a lot of the offense is based on having to keep linebackers at home and respect his run.

This opens up tons of one-on-one opportunities outside and jet sweep misdirection.

I really hope he lasts and doesn't have any injury, but this offense isn't really the same without him as a starter. 
I know... I know, that can be said about many offenses, but his running threat is what makes defenses have to play on the balls of their feet, and he can only absorb so many hits and ankle tackles.

Coaches need to make the threat of run perceived but not run him as often. 10 times/game is up there. 

Vick ran about 6 times/game and most was on busted plays or making something up.

heck, Frank gore averages out to 15 carries a game, and he is the exception.
Alvan Kamara is just over 10.

There is a reason most RB's have a shelf life, and it's because they get hit most every play they have the ball.",,1,1573604738,dr9sps

Yeah, it’s tough to make it in LA and NYC - everyone wants to live here and make it here, so there’s a lot of competition. It’s no wonder your buddy flamed our and went back to his shithole city. Maybe if he was from a tougher city he would have focused on what matters.

Boston is so far behind on technology and planning, it has THE WORST TRAFFIC IN AMERICA, despite being smaller than San Antonio lol: http://inrix.com/scorecard/ 

All the tech firms are in SF and LA for a reason. You’ve got a bunch of self-important douchebags in Boston, the real innovation is happening on the west coast. And you want to know why Philly is a better city than Boston? Because it knows itself. Biggest critics of Philly come from Philly. The city is always changing and challenging itself. It’s far from perfect but the people who come from Philly have an edge. They read bullshit better than anywhere in America. So yeah, I’m not going to sit here and brag about my hometown, it’s got it’s problems, but it’s real as fuck and it’s not trying to pretend to be NY or LA like the massholes up North.",Eagles,1,1572898861,dr9sps

If you are gonna bring up stuff about the 60's I might want to bring up the fact LA had literal wars fought in their streets over racism and Philly bombed their own civilians because of it yet don't get the same label.

Boston made NY and LA. NY and LA are all glitz and glamour about shallow people's rise and fall (entertainers). The most ""important"" thing LA has given us is reality TV and a Internet full of failed models turned pornstars while at least NY was the entrance to the land of the free for millions of immigrants and synonymous with the US before becoming the stinking shithole of a city it is now built on opulence and greed. You laugh but someone I graduated high school with went to LA to work on his rap career, actually made it ""big time"" with some well known artists, then promptly did absolutely jack shit and had to move back with his family after blowing through his money on partying, drugs, and shitty tats  

Boston is about progress and innovation and actual human achievement. It is the medical capital of the country, the higher education capital of the country, one of the biggest banking hubs in the country. If you really think it is the meth capital of the east coast, then holy fuck you really don't know shit. Opiates are the biggest issue and compared to other places, such as Manchester, the Methadone Mile looks tame in comparison. 

Hilarious that you call Boston ""filled with frat bro piss and vomit"" but what is the ""big draw"" of LA and NY? Clubbing and getting shitfaced in clubs. Boston is actually towards to top of cleanest big cities in the US, and unlike either LA or NY, made the major river going through it actually swimmable as questionable as that decision might be.

I think people leaving more has something to do with the weather or high taxes. Generally the best and brightest go to big companies who give them important jobs in states with far less taxes and restrictions than Massachusetts. Then you have the people who went to school on daddy's dime and head off to LA to sleep their way into a job since they took the D's get degrees route to the point where any legitimate company will look them over.",Patriots,1,1572896370,dr9sps

37,"Lol wow. Bostonians are the saddest people on earth. Besides being the most racist city in America, they’re also the most jealous.

You’re hating on the 2 empires of human achievement because Boston will never be as great as either city. There’s a reason why the rich and famous flock to NY and LA.

292,"I would be more worried about the takes now, overrated, cliff etc....last year the fuel was from those media members. They even had the schedule gate thing people talked about. I just got a notification that said they were “steam rolled” idk what game they watched but it didn’t get out of hand until the very end. Even after the fumble 6 it was a 4 point game. I believe after the 8 min drive in the 4th followed by a TD and missed XP it was still somewhat doable but then time got away from them. I personally think the 85 bears were iconic for the time by no means is it the nfl of today, so how can we compare them. Defense now is something that’s about holding offense to a certain score not literally obliterating offense on every play with massive hits. 

I think about all the teams and who is most well rounded. Chiefs before the loss of mahomes were offense first and defense was a bunch of Walmart grocery cart guys. Now the defense has started to step up due to demand. 

Patriots defense needed the offense tonight, they gave up 7 points the momentum changed then.

The packers lost to a mediocre streaky chargers team, they needed defense to stop time. Most NFC teams hate playing from behind

49ers couldn’t just shut the door.

Best overall team this week, goes to the Houston Texans.  Obviously subtracting teams that gained ground without playing with a bye",,1,1572842799,dr9sps
293,"I'm not gonna link a screenshot of my inbox right now after this loss, because I don't believe in calling out other people's accounts by name, but if you saw it you might understand why we act the way we do. 

Edit: Fuck it I'll include the screenshot with the username omitted, because someone PM'd me saying I was full of shit and just playing the victim, which has got to be my favorite take towards Pats fans. [Imagine if you lost today and one random guy decided to spam every single comment you'd made for the last 30 minutes telling you off.](https://i.imgur.com/8wf1s6e.png) That's what we're up against, and that was from a fucking Cowboys fan with no connection to the Patriots or Ravens whatsoever. I'm asking honestly, did you have experiences like that with my fellow Patriots fans after we beat you guys in the AFCCG last year? Because I was there singing the praises of your glorious 50 TD Ketchup boi, not lambasting Chiefs fans until they wanna fucking off themselves...

I DO respect the Ravens for being the better team today, I'm also just at wits fucking end when it comes to neutral fans harassing us. It's to the point where I want any fan who treats other people this way to just get fucking banned on their first offense, Pats fans included, I'm beyond sick of it. You said that you're sick and tired of pats fans that talk shit about every other team, now I want you to empathize to the best of your ability that EVERY time you lose every single other fanbase in the NFL acts like those same fans towards you.

354,All of those teams except the Chiefs have been pretty inconsistent at points this season. Any team in the league can win any given week. Marshall Newhouse is one of the worst tackles in the league but thankfully they’ll have Wynn back in a couple weeks. And frankly the defense and team as a whole needed a wake up game to get them locked in with the better competition they’ll be facing. This is a tough stretch ahead and I could see them losing one of those coming up but they’ll still finish 15-1/14-2. The team will figure it all out and find ways to win,Patriots,1,1572842296,dr9sps

I don't think anyone would say the Ravens' offense is better than the Chiefs', it's just different.

The Patriots got beat from a run heavy offense based around ""non-conventional"" schemes (pistol, QB run, option, etc.).  And it was one that the Ravens executed beautifully.  Just... that's not really the direction of the league.  

We still have Watson and Mahomes on the schedule, but neither has the explosive running capability of Jackson, and both are FAR more refined passers (and both teams have better receiving weapons).  Hyde has been a pleasant surprise, but I don't think either team has a running back on par with Ingram.

You need to breath a little. You are putting too much value into the success and failure of athletes that don't have anything to do with you and do not impact your life.

There is no reason to try target insults at a person, especially when they have done no wrong to you. There is no value in finding validation through ""winning"" arguments online.

The Patriots offense is simply mediocre this year. That's the problem that's going to last, not the fact that the defense is having trouble with Lamar Jackson. Most teams don't have Lamar Jackson.

Building a winning culture is more important. 

If we keep loosing, players are going to give up and it'll be impossible to attract talent / more likely the few good players we do have get feed up and leave in the off season. It fucking sucks to just keep loosing week after week",Jets,1,1572838097,dr9sps

Even the year, 2011, when we swept the division and should've went to the Superbowl, those Browns games never felt like gimmes, with the games usually coming down to a 4th quarter TD to win.

Picks in the new World Football League don't come without sacrifice. Simultaneously, 174 bomb-collars across the Washington/Baltimore area detonate, their wearers, fans, instantly killed as their families look on in what-would-be-horror to someone born a century earlier.

Your opponent is the Patriots, led by the immortal Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. You're absolutely crushing them in what looks to be a hallmark game for you and the franchise (still yet to win a Super Bowl). But this is your year. This is your game. It's 31-0 going into the 2nd half. When the 3rd quarter arrives, so does Tom Brady, with a mouth full of false teeth and a motorized nanotechnology scooter that carries the 60 year old QB downfield in between pass completions and then collapses into a small metal carbon fiber square with the push of a button, stored into a cavity in his robotic metal throwing arm (robobiotic upgrades are of course controversial and facing leagal action from the league office).

&amp;#x200B;

Tom Brady has just completed his 15th consecutive checkdown to a scrappy, undersized, lunch pail receiver from the University of Buffalo on a patented pick route for a touchdown. It's now 31-7 and the game is over. But not for the Patriots. For you and the Browns. The nearly 90 year old Bill Belichick has transcended space and time and transferred his consciousness into a amorphous shimmer of light and stardust. With infinite knowledge of space and time on his side, he has easily unlocked the key to stopping your mortal, corporeal running attack. You fail to score for the rest of the game, Tom Brady, meanwhile, his scooter bouncing irregularly on an increasingly pockmarked field, leads drive after drive down the throat of your anemic, earthling defense. Final score? 38-31. After the game, Bill Belichick takes questions via Skype, grumbling incoherent spacespeak from his cozy abode on a southeastern colony of Pluto, which currently sits at a comfy -220 degrees Fahrenheit.",Ravens,13,1572836919,dr9sps

I can only remember maybe 2 or 3 instances where the Pats got absolutely manhandled in the last decade and in each of those the opposing team didn't muff punts or resort to horrific clock management or any of that shit. You can beat the Pats but you have to play a game without miscues. Too bad the only team in the league that can play a game without game-altering mistakes is the Pats.",,2,1572835967,dr9sps

If you could get those ""throw away"" type QBs that can't find a starting job because they are more run than pass types, or get converted to other positions, you could get them dirt cheap since they have no other offers basically.

27847,"Let's not get carried away. While the Ravens have been running almost at will, this game would be 6-0 if not for a rare neutral zone infraction as they were kicking a field goal on the first drive. Defending gets easier as the field gets shorter, and gaining all those yards on the ground means that you're relatively likely to get to that short field (rather than scoring from further out, which is more likely to happen on a pass play). I don't think anyone should be chalking this up for the Ravens yet.

Edit: instead of downvoting me, how about a small wager if you're confident I'm wrong? I'll bet $5 on the Patriots to win, at even odds, to the first taker.  
Edit2: Offer of the wager is good until the next time the Ravens score (it's 10-0 atm).

31591,"Not yet. He might get there. Vick was the best open-field runner I've ever seen at any position. Better than Barry and Faulk. Better than Steve Smith or Rice or Moss. He was lightning fast and one of the most sudden, agile players ever. He was ridiculous. When he was playing against your team, as soon as he took that first step where you knew he was running, your heart just sunk. You know you were screwed. He also had a cannon for an arm which meant you had to respect the deep part of the field, which opened up a lot for his run game.

Jackson is never going to be as good of a runner as prime Vick. In my opinion, it may be decades before \_anyone\_ is. If he's going to surpass him, it will be because he has the potential to be a better pure passer than Vick was. Vick had accuracy issues, particularly in the short to mid range passing game. He struggled leading RBs properly on screens, for example.

He definitely has upside to be better than Vick ever was. Perhaps even much better. But right now, I'd say no. Not yet.

does jackson have a better case for being better than Vick's Falcons years? Vick made things happen a lot of the time solo (a valuable skill, granted) and had a strong arm but a lot of his excitement was unprecedented, and since there is now precedence, I feel it unfairly dismisses Jackson.

Jackson IMHO is a pocket passer who can play ""normal QB"" while also burning defenders for 28+ yards on the ground. I think Jackson is more equipped as a traditional QB, while possessing the strengths of a predecessor?

At first I was kind nervous and freaked out, I'd just kinda glance at him every now and then, trying not to freak him out. But then my fucking niece starts crying and fidgeting and shit and won't shut up. So I'm trying to keep my niece quiet and not bother Tom, when oops, too late, he gets up and walks over to us. He just smiled and stroked her hair, and asked me what was wrong. I said I didn't know. Then he looked at me with those penetrating hazel eyes and simply said in that soothing voice ""She seems like she's hungry.""
