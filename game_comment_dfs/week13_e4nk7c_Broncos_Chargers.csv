You haven't even watched the replay? lmao ok dude.

It's right here, go ahead and watch frame by frame all you like. Hayward is inside the receiver relative to the ball and looking back for it when he gets taken out from behind.

And here's a screenshot from that for you of Hayward, in better position, with his head around, as contact is made into him by the receiver.

25,What are you talking about? That’s the exact OPPOSITE of what happened. Sutton was running looking over his shoulder for several seconds and Hayward ran into him with no idea where the ball was. They showed the replay several times and the Chargers didn’t challenge because it was so obvious,Broncos,0,1575247269,e4nk7c

41,I don’t care. The penalty was better before the spot foul. And college football rarely has a problem with the incentivized DPIs.

43,That's rich coming from a Titans fan,Broncos,1,1575246923,e4nk7c
44,"That’s not how it works. A receiver can’t just run into a DB to draw PI, DBs have a right to their ground. But if a receiver is clearly playing the ball (which Sutton was) and the DB interferes with his ability to make the catch (which Hayward did) ***AND*** the DB was not playing the ball himself (which Hayward *wasnt*) then it is a penalty. 

That’s why it’s almost never flagged when feet are tangled when BOTH players are playing the ball, it’s incidental, which is different. 

Jesus people, know how this shit works before you bitch about it. The refs suck, yeah, but this was 100% the correct call, and an easy one at that.",Broncos,3,1575246917,e4nk7c
