34,"Drew Brees became the NFL's all-time leader in touchdown passes, throwing for four scores to lead the New Orleans Saints to a 34-7 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Monday night.

The scoring strike that broke Peyton Manning's record of 539 career touchdown passes came in the third quarter, when Brees hit tight end Josh Hill for a 5-yard score. Brees' next pass in the game was the 541st scoring toss of his career, a 28-yard TD to reserve QB and utility player Taysom Hill that put the Saints up 34-0.

''It was special, everything about the night,'' Brees said. ''It just kind of makes your whole life and career flash before your eyes, because I never thought I'd have a chance to be part of something like this.''

The 40-year-old Brees came into the game already holding NFL records for completions with 6,792 and yards passing with 72,577 and built on those numbers by also setting a record for completion percentage in a game. He completed 29 of 30 passes 96.7% for 307 yards before being relieved by Teddy Bridgewater in the fourth quarter. That broke the mark Philip Rivers had held since completing 28 of 29 (96.6%) against Arizona last season.

''He had a hot hand, obviously,'' Payton said. ''Guys were making plays, but that's awfully difficult to do.''
The victory kept the Saints (11-3), who'd already won the NFC South, in the running with San Francisco (11-3) and Green Bay (11-3) for one of the top two seeds in the NFC playoffs. The Colts (6-8) were eliminated from playoff contention after losing their fourth straight and sixth out of seven.

''There's a lot at stake right now relative to these games when you look at the top of the NFC,'' Payton said. ''It's about winning and winning and winning and trying to give yourself the best chance in the postseason.''

Jacoby Brissett struggled at times with accuracy and finished 18 of 34 for 165 yards against a Saints defense looking for redemption after allowing 48 points in a loss to the 49ers a week earlier.
Meanwhile, Colts defenders had no answer for Michael Thomas, who caught 12 passes for 128 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown. Thomas' eighth game this season with at least 10 catches give him 133 for the season, which is also the fourth-highest single-season total in NFL history.
With four more catches, Thomas will pass Antonio Brown and Julio Jones for second most in a season and needs 11 to eclipse Marvin Harrison's record of 143 from 2002.

Tre'Quan Smith caught a 21-yard touchdown pass for New Orleans.

Jordan Wilkins scored the Colts' lone TD on a 1-yard run in the fourth quarter.",,1,1576561196,ebo4ky

I'm a broncos fan, my team isn't free of guilt either, we had the whole salary cap debacle and mcfuckfacedaniels thing. 

Sometimes your team just gets caught doing shitty things, and there is no reason to defend it because in the end the team doesn't really exist unless the fans do.

He went to Purdue and I went to a Big 12 school and was rooming with my cousin who was a 6'6"" 330 lbs. offensive tackle on the football team. So one random evening my buddy call me up and we are shooting the shit. He asked how my cousin was doing (freshman also) and I said he was expected to start after his redshirt year. I asked him how fraternity life was going. He then procceeds to mentions that his pledge brother is a guy by the name of ""Drew Brees"" who is from Texas, plays QB, and is supposed to be good. I literally laughed at him and said, ""Well...if we went to Purdue he can't be that good."" My buddy said, ""You know more about sports than I do, so you are probably right.""

So when games get harder, defenses have more film, it is much colder out and playoffs are on the line (or it is the playoffs) he becomes unstoppable is a reason to say he isn't as good?

1662,"In the modern throwing era this is how it stacks up:

Brady has the strongest narrative and this era has been defined by the Patriot dynasty. His ring count is insane and he and BB have defined what it means to be a championship dynasty. No other QB or team is even close in the modern era to achieving what Tom has achieved with the Patriots. He is the ice in the veins and is who you want when everything is on the line. He is the heart.

Manning has the highest IQ, best presnap read ability, and is the only QB in the modern game who doesn't need an OC in his ear. He is the mind (insert forehead jokes).

Brees is the most accurate QB, and being a small guy, this is just absolutely astonishing. He is tiny and is throwing over a line he can barely see over, and he's somehow more accurate than anyone else. And is now leading in all the prime QB stats (TDs, yards, completion percentage) and he's achieved those records in fewer games than Brady. Pound for pound, he is the best from a star perspective. He is the body/arm.

That's the modern QB situation in one hot take. Brady is the nerve and heart. Manning is the mind. Brees is the arm. They each have their own nitch at the position and depending on your angle, any of those three has a legit debate at being the GOAT.",,1,1576554234,ebo4ky

The difference is that Brady still takes those teams to the superbowl and the Saints don't even make the playoffs.  Go for offensive weapons?  Brees has had an equal amount of great pass catchers and better RBs.  They are both great QB's that have had equal teams and one has had more success.

They need to pair him with someone better like you said maybe it wouldnt feel like he was always yappin. They need new blood in the commentators pool as it is, stale and boring.

12248,"The Colts come in at 6-7 on the year and their playoff hopes are currently on life support. they are two games behind a host of teams that are 8-5 on the year. A loss in this game will knock them out of the playoff race. Still, the Colts were not expected to be as good as they have been after Andrew Luck announced his retirement in training camp. Indy enters this game off a hard-fought 38-35 loss to Tampa Bay on the road. Their defense was shredded in that game and will now be facing a very good New Orleans offense that can be unstoppable at times. Can their defense step up and slow down Brees and company? We shall see. 

The Saints just played a Virginia Cavaliers style basketball game against the San Francisco 49ers. Unfortunately, they lost that game by a score of 48-46. The Saints piled up 465 yards of total offense in the game, but it just wasn't enough as their defense allowed 516 yards of offense. The Saints had been decent on defense for most of the year but that was not the case against a hot San Francisco offense. The Saints are now 20th in the league against the pass but they will be facing the 25th ranked passing attack in this one. Can the New Orleans' pass defense bounce back against a weak passing game? You will have to read on to find out. 

The Colts enter this game at 2-4 on the road for the year and they have averaged 23.0 ppg and have allowed 24.0 ppg in those games. Indianapolis is 22nd in total offense at 341.1 ypg and 17th in scoring at 22.8 ppg. They are 13th in offensive yards per points 15.0 and 20th in yards per play at 5.2, plus 9th in third-down conversion percentage at 43.60%. Let‚Äôs look at the kicking. The Colts are 16th in kick return average at 22.1 and 2nd in punt return average at 10.7, plus they are 15th in net punting at 45.2 and 30th in FG% at 68%.

On defense, the Colts are 15th in total yards allowed at 345.1 ypg and 16th in scoring defense at 22.7 ppg. Indianapolis has a defensive yards per point average of 15.2, which is 19th in the league and 20th in yards per play at 5.7. Lastly, the Colts are 1st in penalties per game at 5.2 and 16th in turnover margin per game at 0.0.

On defense, the Colts are 15th in total yards allowed at 345.1 ypg and 16th in scoring defense at 22.7 ppg. Indianapolis has a defensive yards per point average of 15.2, which is 19th in the league and 20th in yards per play at 5.7. Lastly, the Colts are 1st in penalties per game at 5.2 and 16th in turnover margin per game at 0.0.

The Saints enter this game at 5-2 here at home for the year and they have averaged 27.6 ppg and have allowed 25.1 ppg in those games. New Orleans is 12th in total offense at 369.4 ypg and 5th in scoring at 26.5 ppg. They are 6th in offensive yards per points 14.0 and 9th in yards per play at 5.9, plus 11th in third-down conversion percentage at 42.50%. Let‚Äôs look at the kicking. The Saints are 12th in kick return average at 22.3 and 4th in punt return average at 9.6, plus they are 11th in net punting at 45.9 and 10th in FG% at 88%.

On defense, the Saints are 13th in total yards allowed at 338.3 ypg and 17th in scoring defense at 22.8 ppg. New Orleans has a defensive yards per point average of 14.9, which is 22nd in the league and 13th in yards per play at 5.4. Lastly, the Saints are 25th in penalties per game at 7.7 and 3rd in turnover margin per game at +0.8.

The Colts have done some things right this year but the Saints are off a very tough loss here at home and I will look for them to bounce back in a big way. The Colts can run the ball and they have an edge in that department but that edge is nothing like the edge that the Saints have in the passing game. New Orleans has thrown for 305.1 ypg at home this year while the Colts have allowed 277.3 ypg passing on the road. That is a huge advantage for the Saints.

New Orleans is also 1st in the league in offensive pass completion percentage while the Colts are 30th in defensive pass completion percentage. The Colts will not slow down this saints offense enough to keep this one close. They will also not find enough off to keep the game close. The Saints are off a bad defensive game but I will look for them to bounce back on that side of the ball against a less than stellar Indy offense. Take the Saints to win by at least two TDs.¬†

**ULTIMATE LEFTOVER MNF NACHOS!**

- Baking sheet, find one. Cover in foil. Rub a half-teaspoon of olive oil on the foil for potential unforeseen and potentially tragic extraction complications later.

- make a generous bed of tortilla chips and cover with:

- leftover taco meat (a single can of low-sodium black beans can stretch that bitch big time, big truss, and hopefully you got some in there)

- finely diced fresh white onion

- LIBERAL distribution of [Cotija cheese crumbles](https://www.cheese.com/cotija/) (if you've never bought a wheel before, it's usually SUPER cheap in your local grocery, and will change your cuisine game instantly and has tons of uses for numerous other things in your arsenal, including pastas, salads, soups, etc.). 

- additional sprinkled shredded cheese of your choice (I prefer sharp cheddar in this particular build but ""Mexican/Fiesta blends"" and the like also work well)

- a crown of evenly placed jalapeno peppers (jarred or fresh sliced).

Put that naughty bitch in the oven for 13-15 minutes at a pre-heated 300 degree oven. Make a custard cup of salsa/guac/MORE hot cheese sauce on the side and/or garnish the final product with your favorite hot sauce.
