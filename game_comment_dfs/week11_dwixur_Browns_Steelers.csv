123,"&gt; Rudolph acted poorly throughout the incident. I'd argue that he was the first person to do something outside of the normal context of football.

This is probably what our disagreement is pivoting on.

I'm hoping some more angles come out that show the initial tackle. It looked pretty egregious to me, but the only shot the broadcast showed was a pretty wide angle.

I think it really comes down to how bad the late hit was. If it wasn't as intentional as I assumed, then I probably wouldn't be defending Rudolph in terms of instigation. Rudolph may have even said something to Garrett that was over the line. I watched Rudolph's post-game interview and all he said when asked about what started it was, ""he had some words.""

As far as the rules go, I still don't think *any* player would be ejected *just* for pulling at a helmet if it stays on.

&amp;nbsp;

That being said, I do kind of get where you're coming from considering how these things usually pan out. Anyone involved is typically held accountable regardless of individual rules that are in play. He probably got a pass for being a QB, as is the case with a number of subjective calls. 

As it stands, I agree with the refs' decisions only seeing what happened, but I'm starting to think Rudolph may have had a bit more of the impetus than I originally thought.",Seahawks,1,1573799958,dwixur

152,"I understand that Rudolph did not remove Garrett's helmet.  I don't think that Garrett really slammed Rudolph down.  It was a bit more than necessary, but to me, it looked like he thought that the clock might be running and wanted to delay the next snap - he was kinda trying to bear hug Rudolph and hold him down, which is annoying but normal enough (a few fights have started with that intentional delay stuff).  

My point is that given the balance of Rudolph's actions, he should have been ejected.  An ejection does not have to be triggered by a single punch or something.  

Rudolph acted poorly throughout the incident. I'd argue that he was the first person to do something outside of the normal context of football.  I think he was more responsible for starting the fight (obviously not the worst offender in the fight).  He maliciously went after Garrett's head with his hands.  He attempted to pull off Garrett's helmet.  He continued to be aggressive once on his feet.  It looked like he was standing over Garrett, taunting him while he was down (before Rudolph got decked from behind). I think he even continued to be aggressive once he got up.  If you look at the full picture, I think Rudolph should have been tossed.

To be clear, I think that there should have been about four ejections on the play.  I think the NFL has a bad habit of ejecting players inconsistently in fights and not punishing instigators well.

I never said anything about you defending Garrett.

&gt; I'm pretty sure intentionally removing another player's helmet is an auto-ejection

I'm not familiar with that rule, but I suppose it would be completely reasonable. In any case, Rudolph did *not* remove anyone's helmet, so it's still pretty silly to suggest he be ejected based on a rule that he didn't break.

He certainly could have easily been flagged for unnecessary roughness, but you said he should be ejected, which is all I'm arguing against.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Rudolph intentionally started a fight

Not that it should affect the punishments, but Garrett body slammed Rudolph's head into the ground *long* after he had thrown the ball. It's not like Rudolph was completely unprovoked. Garrett started that fight. (So I guess I'm arguing that now too haha)",Seahawks,1,1573796790,dwixur

That said, I'm pretty sure intentionally removing another player's helmet is an auto-ejection, particularly after a play is over.  Rudolph was clearly trying to do that and was only stopped by Garrett's chin strap - Rudolph had his hand pulling up inside the back of the helmet and on the face mask. If you want to put it another way, Rudolph intentionally started a fight and arguably hit another player in the head.  If you take everything together, I would say that Rudolph should have been tossed.  No suspension but a solid fine.",49ers,1,1573795406,dwixur

Rudolph was totally innocent, his hand was merely caught as he 100% tried to gently stand up after he was ruthlessly picked up and suplexed into the ground minutes after throwing the ball. Then Myles Garrett went into wild animal mode because Rudolph had the nerve to stand up. Of course, having your helmet put in a *slightly* uncomfortable position doesn‚Äôt justify doing the same to the person who did that to you, but god forbid you see someone do that to your quarterback. You can‚Äôt be held responsible for your actions at that point, the person who did that to your quarterback deserves to be kicked in the head.",Seahawks,1,1573795321,dwixur

Like he could have just stopped at the first or second action, that was enough. 

Mad respect to Pouncey, that was the second time he defended our QB1 when someone came after him. He does not give a fuck about the repercussions.

Even more respect to Baker at the interview after the game. He could have easily said it was a mutual exchange and that they where both in the wrong, but he outlined that Garett's actions where inexcusable behavior for a sports rivalry and that he was hurting the team by doing what he did.

Truthfully, most rich people prefer either a product where everything works, to be an early adopter, or something simple that works reliably.

What's amazing though is how out of touch a lot of these corporations are, especially the ones that shipped jobs overseas, that they suddenly don't have as much a market as they used to (because most of their workforce just went without jobs that pay enough to afford a new car.)

The awkward lurching around, seeking that market segment they seem to have lost. They'll say anything- see Gillette's ad, for example, if it means 'new market segment.'

Back in the his high school days, his team would be erupting in cheers for ‚Äúlaying him out.‚Äù

Second, the one delivering the blow is less likely to be hurt. You are able to use the top of your helmet and by lifting your shoulders, the helmet is essentially lifted off the crown of your head, supported by the shoulder pads. The one delivering the hit is able to transmit the force down through your shoulders instead of directly to the top of the head and down the neck.

To eliminate the advantage of doing such a thing, they made this illegal touching rule. So he took himself out of the play, basically. Or was supposed to, hence the penalty.

No such situation exists in the 49ers play. Defender stepping on the boundary during the jumble of blocking and tackling isn't relevant to anything. No intention, no advantage, no rule being needed.

It's an intense high and there's no way of stopping it, once it starts, you've got 6-8 hours before it's done, so you have to be REALLY CAREFUL when consuming edibles, because you need to wait TWO HOURS before you add any more if you don't feel it, and you can easily eat too much, which won't kill you, but it sucks.
