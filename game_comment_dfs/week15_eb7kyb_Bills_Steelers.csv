15,"Not really.  It's too cold for an abundance of homeless people.  

I live in Albany and we get crust punks occasionally in the summer but thats about it.  A few of our homeless are actually respected community figures.

24,"I don't disagree. Here's what I said to another person who replied. I didn't mean it as an insult.

&gt; Sorry what I meant was the 2-3 times I saw Allen kind of ""get stuck"" with the ball in Singletary's hands. I think Collinsworth mentioned it too. I can't decide if it is planned or if it was indecision. I didn't mean it as a slight, though. Just an observation.",Ravens,1,1576501704,eb7kyb

34,"It's not that bad. Nightlife will be disappointing. Public transportation will be non-existent. There will be the general malaise of addiction, but it'll be much more subtle. There will be a much tighter strata of diversity. Depending on where you settle, you might not be ready to convert your drive time from minutes to miles. If you love Mexican or Korean food, you will have to search hard to find alternatives. If you're interested in being armed, you won't find any silly laws or unnecessary hassles. Regardless of location, farmland will be much cheaper, if you're so inclined. There is great hiking and camping, but it might require a long drive to get to it.",Eagles,1,1576482876,eb7kyb

47,"I mean yeah I get it. Listen, I live in NC now, whole family is from Pittsburgh and there's a reason my parents relocated a while back. The area back then was just majorly depressing and didn't have a good outlook, you'll kindof feel it when you start to head further out from the core. Now, I personally love the vibe of the area (certain neighborhoods especially) and will probably move back someday now that the economy there doesn't suck donkey balls. There is a certain culture in Pittsburgh that I feel is unique in the United States, neighborhoods and everything in general just have a lot of ""character"". It's a gruff type of character, but it's there. I'd watch this [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/audioslave44/) to get a feel for things. A lot of interesting history around the area too, from colonial history to the unions and their struggles. Plus, life there is actually affordable who would've guessed...

The vast majority of Californians I've talked to, people from the Bay in particular, have this very one dimensional view of the US outside of the west coast. South is all confederates, Midwest white nationalists, Rust belt unemployed heroin addicts, Northeast rude overworked schmucks. Some told me that they would be afraid to go to my home city because of ""guns"" or racism, despite it being an urban state capitol. Like, this whole city is a giant suburb full of tech workers lmao. So I always caution people from the west coast from moving out here, it's a lot different than what you may be ""used to"". In Pittsburgh you may see some confederate flags (blegh). You wont be surrounded by the same type of diversity that you may (or may not, idk) value. Food will be different. The economy will be vastly different. Most importantly, people will value different things. Sometimes for the better, maybe sometimes for the worse. I don't want to equate it to moving to a new country, but it will have a degree of shock to it.

Idk your political lean, your life outlook, your career situation, anything about you to be honest. I made that generalization because I've found it to be overwhelmingly true sadly. If you're open to the prospect of moving out to the burgh I'd highly recommend it. I'd just encourage you to visit (during winter) to see if you like it. Some do, some don't. If you're more of a rural type it won't be super bad. Buffalo will probably be similar but I can't speak for there.

Also in terms of heroin addicts, that's a big problem in Pittsburgh (and Buffalo). There's just not as much subway/visible public space for them to camp out in (and yeah I get the BART isn't really much of a subway either but point still stands). Nobody is implying that the bay area is some fairy land, I would argue you guys have more ""issues"" out there than most of the country.",Steelers,1,1576475128,eb7kyb

74,"I honestly don't even think the issue with Jordan was the punch.  Punching is an automatic ejection.

I think they just ruled it as after the whistle.  He wasn't penalized for throwing a punch (he did, but to get the ball loose, which happens A LOT); he was punished for post-whistle conduct.

I think it was the next play that someone tried to punch the ball out of CMac's hands, but failed.  No penalty was called.",Panthers,1,1576471276,eb7kyb

ARTICLE 2. FALSE START. It is a False Start if the ball has been placed ready for play, and, prior to the snap, an offensive
player who has assumed a set position charges or moves in such a way as to simulate the start of a play, or if an offensive player
who is in motion makes a sudden movement toward the line of scrimmage. Any quick abrupt movement by a single offensive
player, or by several offensive players in unison, which simulates the start of the snap, is a false start.

is an obvious attempt to draw an opponent offside**",Colts,5,1576468729,eb7kyb

They put him in a large padded room and a beautiful woman walks in. 

Naked. 

She says, 'you have one hour. If you catch me, you can fuck me.

Ben chases her for the hour but never gets to her. But he loses 5 pounds.

Next day another, even more beautiful woman comes to his room. Naked again. And it's the same deal.

Ben chases her even harder and fails. But he loses 10 pounds.

The 3rd day, he decides to wait at the door and grab the woman who walks in.

Except when the door opens it's a giant gorilla with a thick 10 inch erection who bursts through to stand right next to him. He can smell it's dank fur and hot stink breath. Around its neck is a sign that says, 'If I catch you, I will fuck you.'",,1,1576461882,eb7kyb

14885,"True Story about Jerome Bettis. I was a Marine overseas and my mom passed away. The Marine Corps got me home as fast as possible. Marines do not go to civil areas like airports in camies. I did not really have a choice. I was going to bury my Mom. So was in my desert camo.

On a flight from Atlanta to Houston, where I live, The bus was there flying in 1st class. I really did not care. The flight stewardesses did and wanted to have me meet him. Awkward all around. I did not know what to do. I smelt like desert and bad BO. I just wanted to go home and cry. I already buried a friend in war and now my mom.

Once we were in flight, the stewardess asked me if I want to meet him. This was 2007 so Jerome already retired and was doing whatever. I did not know how to say no. I just went with it all. I literally just wanted to cry. I was dirty and smelly. 

The stewardess introduced us. So OK. Jerome had 2 first class seats all to himself. I am sure he himself wanted to be left the fuck alone as well. 

As soon as he got my demeanor, he kinda knew I did not want to be a part of this. He scooted over and told me to sit down next to him. 

We talked for 15-20 minutes. When you are down, kindness can be exhausting emotionally. I asked to go back to my seat so I could sleep. But that conversation with the Bus was the most uplifting things I could have experienced. 

He wanted to Know about my mom and LcpL Tambrillo. My roommate who just died a few weeks ago. 

The Bus Knows and cares about my mom and he knows and cares about my friend. That means more to me than I could ever comprehend.

Like half of the comments I've seen on this sub are so obviously written by non-quackers that it's almost humorous.

When I was in high school (3 year starter for our varsity birdwatching team) I would get a full-on quack going and attract the shit outta them waterfowl. My coaches called me ""Devlin Hodges"" as a nickname caus I had such a beak for the call and for those three weeks I was considered the most feared caller in our woods. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the geese in the lake but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

So, yeah. I hope yall can understand why I feel like their's such a big disconnect between myself and your typical redditor. Please tell me I'm not the only one who feels this way lol",Bills,185,1576457526,eb7kyb
