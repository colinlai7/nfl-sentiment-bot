45,"Better than the shitty rams, cardinals, steelers, browns, buccs, bengals, redskins, and panthers.

- The Cowboys are better than the Bengals, Redskins, the Bucs, and the Browns.  

- I'd say that they're about on par with Pittsburgh and Arizona (who is better than the record).

- The Cowboys ***are not*** better than the Rams and Panthers.  

I've answered your question.  Answer mine.  Why do you think that Dallas is better than those teams that the Niners have played?  

Dallas' only win vs. an average team was versus Philly (and Philly has tons of problems).

51,"Lmfaooo that is my whole point. You are literally using a what if to start your argument. You said you guys played so much better and you're using a ""what if"" to back it up. The fact is you took a fat fucking L to the face. I never implied you played bad, just not better. And I can back that up by linking the final score of the game if you want. I'm going to bed.

Send 4 or 5 and it's a very non-trivial chance the OL holds up or a young QB scrambles for time.

2939,"Those ads are targeted towards consumers (they do separate ads for the actual doctors, usually not on TV).

And yeah, the hope is that you'll ask your doctor about that medicine you heard about on TV. They can take requests into consideration if they think it's appropriate. Kind of a long shot, but what they want is to build an association with the particular illness that they're intended to treat. The more they blast that message out, the more people will mentally link it to the illness. And when people ask for something by name, they usually get it, so it's a huge win for the drug company.

Tylenol being the go-to painkiller is a prime example of what they hope to achieve. Of course, Tylenol is OTC and not prescription, but the idea is the same.",Bills,1,1573445500,dukg5p

3560,"The defense has to react. The offense has a plan set ""OK, this tackle is gonna block this guy, this running back is gonna go through the hole here, we've got a plan set up here""

The defense has no such plan, because they don't know what the offense is running. They just have to react to whatever is happening. So if they see something before the snap that they didn't see when lining up, they're allowed to move, as they have the inherent disadvantage.

Now, if the offensive line moves before the ball is snapped, that tells the defense (who already have the disadvantage) that their plan has gone into motion. Now it's up to the defense to get into instinct and try to stop the play, even though the play technically hasn't started yet. This is known as a false start.

The defense can move, because of the disadvantage, but cannot pass the line of scrimmage before the ball has been snapped.

There's often some degree of PI going on in these types of situations, but unless it's blatant it shouldn't be getting called either. If it's not reviewable, then it doesn't get called in a bang/bang real time play and all is fine.

But now that the no PI call can be over turned, they technically should be going back and calling all of these. But if they did, it would expose the fact that by their rules PI happens a lot more often than it gets called, and if it actually got called all the time then the NFL would suck for fans to watch.

10535,"To everyone saying the check down to Rudy was a bad pass:

1. The pass rush was right on top of Kirk. The play didn't have time to fully develop as much as they wanted, he took his escape valve.

2. We get the ball back to begin the second half. We just made a statement by driving down the field and going into the half with any kind of league. Preserving that state of mind and attitude going into the half is the top priority. 

3. If Kirk threw that ball to the end zone under duress and it got picked everyone would be clowning him for making a ""Kirk mistake"" and saying he should have taken the check down to a wide open Rudolph. I think he's showing that he knows his limits and isn't taking the kinds of risky ""hero throws"" he was earlier in the season that led to untimely turnovers. 

We made a statement drive, took the easy points, and preserved our momentum going into the second half. I think we did just fine.",Vikings,6,1573441310,dukg5p

Rudy is definitely into the latter half of his career, but he‚Äôs still automatic when it comes to catching anything in his area.

They have this new thing always on called the EXP Share that allows your entire party to share experience with each other after an opposing Pokemon faints or is captured.  They've had it for the past 2 generations, but they gave the option to turn it off.  The reason so many players turn it off because it results in your entire party becoming extremely over leveled.

In the new games, they are making it so that you cannot turn the EXP Share off.  They did the same thing for Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee, but people forgave them because they weren't official main series games.  But this game *is* main series and they're forcing you to always play with the EXP Share on.

When Todd Gurley tries to take a wing Donald swats him away and says ""Buy your own"". This just hurts me because I've had ""friends"" who weren't loyal to me at all and would totally do me like that. They talk to me at school, when no one better to talk to is there, but as soon as another guy higher on the totem pole walks in, I get tossed aside. I'm not saying they should exclusively talk to me, but at least include me in the conversation. And these people never invite me to anything. I haven't gone to something in three months, when I ask them why they don't invite me to anything, they deny they go anywhere but I see their posts on their social media accounts.
