16,"A good coach schemes for the players he has. Mitch is bad but has shown *some* good things. I’m not saying he’d be anywhere close to above average, but Nagy needs to call plays that suit Trubisky.

Cut the gimmicks, cut the weird personnel groupings. No more smoke and mirror bullshit. That worked for one year and everyone figured it out. 

Seeing as their draft capital is nonexistent next year, idk what the answer is at QB. Mitch will probably be there for another year or two. Time for Nagy to step up or get out.

37,"Get rid of Pace, Trubisky, and Nagy. Regime change.

1. Pace traded up to take Mitch, who was by most accounts a very raw and unproven QB. He started 13(?) games in his college career. Pace also wastes high draft picks on busts, and then trades away draft capital to try to rebuild. 

2. Nagy is the problem with the offense, not Mitch. Nagy refuses to adjust his system to his players. He's dogmatic and set in his ways of gimmicks, trickery, and obscure personnel groupings. It worked for one year and now he got figured out. He says things like ""I didn't come here to run the I-Formation"" and tries to defend running less than 10 times a game. 

3. Mitch isn't great, but he's also been put in a terrible position. In a more traditional offense, he could be serviceable or above average. Instead, he's on Nagy's wild ride. Imagine going from a straight forward, vanilla offense at UNC, to John Fox's bullshit, to Nagy's hair brained ""complex"" system. That's a lot to adjust to, especially when your coach's gimmick system has already been figured out. 

It's a mess of everything right now. From poor drafting to poor management, it's a problem without a real end in sight or light at the end of the tunnel.",Bears,4,1574053774,dxvl2v

All of the bears QBs on that roster basically had the same rating, all low 70s/high 60s.

And now that other teams have caught on and figured out the gimmicks, he refuses to adjust and instead lets the players take the heat.

219,"So it's a little complicated but yes if it had been a TE there is no problem. You need 7 on the LOS by having that lineman uncovered the Rams only had 6 on the LOS. All 4 people in the backfield are eligible. All end men on the line are eligible to catch and be downfield as well (this is the basis behind illegal man downfield). This makes a total of 6 eligible players, with 5 ineligible players on any given play. 

Technically all players with numbers between 50-79 are ineligible by default and they HAVE to be covered. If you want one of these players to be eligible that player must report to the referee that they are going to be eligible.

In what happened a player between 50-79 was uncovered on the LoS this technically makes him eligible. However, he's not allowed to be eligible because he didn't report as eligible. Additionally this means that the Rams had 7 eligible players instead of 6 which is what it usually is.",Packers,1,1574050706,dxvl2v

1583,"This season cannot end soon enough. Watching this offense is physically painful. It is utterly mind blowing how bad our offense is. It is inexcusable. Trashbisky would be lucky to even be a practice squad player on any other team in the league. The playcalling is somehow even worse. The receivers who can’t even catch a football top it as well. We deserve all the shit we’ve gotten this year and then some.

It is this lack of trust, inability to make reads et al that are hindering Trubisky from being more than average. That is why I think the Bears will say ""fuck it"" on next season, and draft Trevor Lawrence as their Franchise QB in 2020 (unless of course somehow the Patriots sacrifice virgins under Gillette Stadium and trade a king's ransom up to the #1 pick instead).",Broncos,5,1574048858,dxvl2v

&gt;Can't believe we traded up for him, I wanted Watson but whatever fuck me I guess

&gt;Next season rolls around, chode QB getting a lot of hype to be better, it's our year!

&gt;Chode QB has somehow become worse in every statistical category

&gt;Scheme WR's open every play but chode can't throw the ball past 10 yards

&gt;Chode QB can't throw left 
&gt;WHAT THE FUCK ZOOLANDER

&gt;Chode QB no longer knows how to progress past 1st read

&gt;Can't run the ball because defenses know to stack the box, forcing chode to win through the air

Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
