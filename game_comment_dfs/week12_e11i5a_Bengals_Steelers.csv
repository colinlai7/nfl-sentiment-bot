Then Ben has a nagging injury through the preseason and they trade away Dobbs as he wins the backup.  He got an advanced warning even that he might start with Ben's nagging elbow!  They immediately trade a first round pick and create a super-defense to try and support him. The offensive line is good, skills positions top-heavy but worthy.
