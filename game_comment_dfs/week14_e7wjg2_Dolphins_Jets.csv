1,"Yeah, if you go back and look at it, you'll see he pulls it in takes a couple steps, goes to the ground in the end zone, and then it is stripped into his feet.",Jets,1,1575846560,e7wjg2
2,Ah okay. The replay in the stadium was shitty and only really showed the moment it was caught. Didn’t really show the steps,Dolphins,1,1575846231,e7wjg2
3,"lol, that would be pretty remarkable to think to fake getting pulled backwards in an awkward direction when the ball is definitely catchable without you getting turned...",Jets,1,1575845532,e7wjg2
4,Yeah I know he did. That doesn't always mean it's 100% true but I think in this case they believe they have a good one and want to give him time.,Jets,1,1575844591,e7wjg2

11,100% agree.  I hate the constant bull shit back and forth on what is and isn't PI.  Part of the reason I rarely watch this sport anymore.,Jets,1,1575840452,e7wjg2

13,I think it was technically PI. I'd be okay with a no-call on that late in a game but I can't be made about them calling it. Granted it wouldn't hurt if they were more inconsistent,Dolphins,1,1575840127,e7wjg2
14,"Aww you're jealous of Darnold, that's cute",Jets,1,1575839961,e7wjg2
15,lol?  If we give him a good oline to work behind he is going to be solid.  He's got a good head when he has more than 1.2 seconds to think back there.,Jets,1,1575839803,e7wjg2

27,[deleted],,1,1575839659,e7wjg2
28,"It was the right call though.  I feel like we should all be able to agree on that when you see the receiver being turned prior to the ball getting there that's DPI.

33,"This has been a bad game, but let's be real here; Sam Darnold is a better QB than Mark Sanchez ever was. If he'd been on those 09/10 teams there's a pretty good chance we have 2 SB championships, the talent disparity between those teams and the team Darnold plays for now is insane. You're talking about the best oline in the league with the top rushing attack and top defense vs... this.",,1,1575839531,e7wjg2
34,"Meh, officials fucked us there but that's ok. Neither of these teams is going to the playoffs, Darnold is clearly a bust, we'll have a better pick than the Jets, and they are still stuck with Gase for another year at minimum.",Dolphins,-5,1575839523,e7wjg2
