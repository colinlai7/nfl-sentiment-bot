I'm sure you still aren't good with the officiating last night and again I want to agree with you that it was. 

I'm only sending you this message to let you know that yesterday's game would still sting a little for me if my team had been on the short end of those bad calls and knowing that it probably did for you brings me no joy.

1. I am sick and god damned tired of officials blowing whistles too early. On the Kelce fumble, what is the point of blowing the whistle immediately? It wasn‚Äôt quick enough to be forward progress, and you‚Äôre potentially nullifying a Patriots TD. 

2. Belicheck challenges a ball spotting. YES. It WAS a first down, but the spot was AT LEAST a yard off. Belicheck is challenging the SPOT OF THE BALL, NOT if it was a first down. The challenge should be a good one, albeit with a first down, and he should keep his timeout and his challenge... 

3. Hello, that was a touchdown, not down at the 3. It was close, sure... but can‚Äôt the booth review this??? See #2 for the fact that New England should‚Äôve had another challenge in the bag anyway.

It is in some ways the best way to lose, because there were signs of life on offense, and the defense and ST showed they still have it after a couple rough games.

I apologise for my snarky reply and yes it was that. I agree with you 100% when I say I just want games to be called correctly on both sides. 

Last year when our season wrapped up with a loss to the Pats I told my friends there was no reason to hang our heads. You guys have a great coach, great QB and great franchise. 

I don't follow your team all of the time and I'm guessing you guys have been on the receiving end of some bad call. I feel like my team is a well. There were calls on both sides of the game that I thought were bad. Romo called out bad calls on both sides. 

So, I do sympathize with you. I don't want bad calls for either of us.  I never want a win with an * next to it. New England has multiple wins with * next to them in the eyes of many in the NFL community. Tonight was one for the Chief's with a *.

Mahomes didn't handle things as well as I hoped - interception right away seemed to be nerves and he was so gun-shy in the second half the Pats were bringing a lot of pressure which led to poor, over conservative results.

245,Also the uncalled DPI right before Brady's run was really really blatant.,,7,1575853315,e7zbi0
246,"you have to go back a bit for context but here is my summary:

First of all, The refs were making a bunch of tickey tak calls all game including several times throwing a flag and then picking it up afterwards. Just really sloppy reffing overall, but there was a series of particular egregious reffing in the fourth quarter. 

1. Pat's use their first challenge on a play where the Cheif's got a first down, but there is a pretty suspect Pick and the spot was clearly off by at least a yard. Ref's let is stand as called. 

2. The Cheifs fumble the ball and the Pat's defender picks it up with a mostly open field ahead of him, but the ref's blow the whistle, stopping the play dead and rule it down by contact. Pats challenge and win the turn over but were still robbed of the potential Defensive points or at least significant yardage. 

3. On the resulting drive Brady throws a pass to his WR who runs down the line and dives in for a touchdown. But the refs rule that he stepped out of bounds. Replay clearly shows that he was in bounds the entire time, but the patriots are now out of challenges. They are forced to settle for a FG.

4. On the chiefs next possession the refs make a couple of bad make up calls, and the Cheifs go 3 and out. 

5. On the final drive Brady throws it deep to Dorsett who is clearly being wrapped up by the defender, but no PI is called. Again, the Pats are out of challenges so it remains an incomplete pass.",Patriots,1,1575853309,e7zbi0

When the refs seemed 50-50 about whether his foot touched out of bounds before getting into the endzone or not, if they had just called it a TD, they could have reviewed it and got the call right; instead, since it was a ""non-scoring play"", the Pats would be forced to challenge.

My coaches called me ""speedhawk"" as a nickname caus I had such a nose for the football and for those three seasons I was considered the most feared safety in our conference. Senior year I led my team to the state semifinals only to get fucked over by the refs in the 4th but that's another conversation (DM me if you're interested in hearing about it)

It has been rare that the Patriots were just flat out inferior, so we don't really know what that looks like.

Maybe it's what we're seeing now. They've beaten a whole bunch of bad to mediocre opposition, but whenever they've played anyone good, they haven't just lost. They've gotten blown out. Maybe this is what a mediocre Patriots team looks like. They beat the bad teams, play close games against the mediocre teams, and lose big to good teams.

I am beyond hate. 18 years. 18 years have I put up with the Patriots and their nonstop Patriots winning. I have had to watch Tom Brady eat his fucking W's since 2001. My friend is a Broncos fan, he says ""Oh yEaH I HatE tHe PaTriOtS tOo BrO"" and I say You dumb bitch. Shut the fuck up with your dumb bullshit. We have to play them TWICE A YEAR, EVERY YEAR. and he says ""yeah but"" and I can't even hear him because at this point I'm thinking about that youtube thumbnail of a fat shirtless little boy tom brady at his combine and there is blood in my ears and hate in my heart. I can just imagine Bill Belichick watching him waddle is way through the 40 and licking his lips. FUCK.

And don't even get me started on their fans. One of my ""friends"" is a Warriors and a Patriots fan. THEY'RE ON OPPOSITE COASTS YOU FUCK. And he has the nerve to call me out for being a lakers and a dolphins fan. LA DIDN'T HAVE A FOOTBALL TEAM WHEN I STARTED WATCHING, YOU STUPID BITCH. I CHOSE THE TEAM WITH THE PRETTY COLORS CAUSE I DIDNT REALIZE THEY WOULD HAVE SATAN HIMSELF IN THEIR DIVISION. AND THE PHINS AND LAKERS SUCK. I love how on this subreddit you can go to any given comment thread and find some idiot with a patriots flair talking about tom brady. Every patriots fan would let tom brady shit in their cereal every morning for a FORTNIGHT just to suckle one of his ring fingers. and I just KNOW that they're reading this right now, because they infest game threads like a ganon of leeches, and halfway through skimming it with their limited reading skills they realize they have an erection, so they ctrl+shift+n and search tom brady long hair until they bust a nut onto the keyboard, posting comments like ""if this wasnt brady people would think this was cool"" and ""Le Belichick is da dark lord XD XD"" or just ""mmmphmmgofgpsngfjg"" because they still have Tom Brady's DICK in their mouth.

They say don't cheer for injuries. Fuck that. I hope Tom Brady gets hit by an airplane. He'll be screaming at one of his coaches who works day in and day out for him, because the pats are only up 49-3, and some insane fan will just lose it and prison shank him 18 times, and then once more for good measure. And I'll watch that shit on youtube for the rest of my life. I'll be there at his funeral to comfort Gisele with hors d'oeuvres but when it's my turn to sprinkle dirt on his coffin I'll drop a picture of Eli Manning instead. And when security drags me out for causing a rumpus I'll just laugh and laugh, because I know that I hired the insane fan to do it. It was my plan all along. All I had to do was promise him the chance to wear top bradys skin. Oh, you thought the funeral was closed casket out of respect? No, no my friend. His SKIN is gone. Where is it now, you ask? It's been... distributed. A small bribe to the chef was all it took. And now Gisele is wondering why her pig in a blanket has the faint taste of avocado ice cream, and the tears begin again as my laughter drowns out the wind and the rain. And the world keeps spinning.
