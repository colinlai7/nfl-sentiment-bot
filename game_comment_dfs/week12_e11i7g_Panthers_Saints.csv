&gt;Running forward and leaping across the line of scrimmage in an obvious attempt to block a field goal or Try Kick, unless the player was in a stationary position on the line of scrimmage when the ball was snapped. A player who is behind the line of scrimmage before, or at the snap, may run forward and leap, provided he does not cross the line of scrimmage or land on players.

&gt;What this means is that players will still be allowed to jump straight up to block a kick, but will not be able to take a running start and jump over the line of blockers. Linemen who are stationary at the snap will also still be allowed to leap, and there is no restriction on landing on players.

While all of those ""attractive"" players from the Lakers look like the exact same mediocre players and the Hayes comment is truly delusional. What has he flashed that could remotely suggest that? He looks like a more in-control like Javale McGee than anything else, it's way too early to tell.

Like holy shit did you just start following the team when they drafted Zion? Your whole season last year was an absolute fucking unmitigated disaster and so was the trading away of your star player that was given to you because your shitty team needed a buyer back in 2012.

‚ÄúIs that why yall have a worse record than us?‚Äù

- Well for one its Griff‚Äôs first season in charge. I‚Äôm not expecting a fairly young team like us to be a guaranteed playoff team just yet though we have been fairly competitive and have been a better team than your trash tier Hornets. We also play in the far tougher western conference. 

‚ÄúEffectively peanuts and late first round picks‚Äù

- One of those peanuts, Brandon Ingram, is playing like a star. Another peanut Josh Hart, has been a good role player and hustle guy for us. Another peanut, Lonzo Ball, has been decent but still has some work to do. The three peanuts we got in this year‚Äôs draft, Hayes, NAW, and Didi Louzada, have looked promising. Hayes in particular is looking like he‚Äôll be one of the top big men in the league at some point. The rest of the peanuts are simply draft capital which can be useful in trades. We also have a Zion. 

Griff also made this team attractive enough to attract quality players like JJ Redick and Derrick Favors.

5762,No sir,Panthers,1,1574618480,e11i7g
5763,"Michael Thomas is an elite slot/possession receiver trapped in an X/Z/outside receiver's body.

The way he catches the ball and the skill using his body to block out defenders and make space isn't what you usually see from a guy normally lining up on the outside.

It's really impressive to watch.",Chiefs,2,1574618416,e11i7g
5764,Or that bucs game last year,Saints,4,1574618369,e11i7g
5765,ew,Panthers,3,1574618354,e11i7g
5766,Prolly keep them from that first round bye so they get a good rhythm for the playoffs and win the sb,Panthers,1,1574618294,e11i7g
5767,Surprised that we get Romo and Jim Nantz. Not complaining though. üëè,Saints,3,1574618253,e11i7g
5768,Lol we just got destroyed by the falcons too,Panthers,8,1574618247,e11i7g

5770,Fuck yeah! Nantz and Romo!,Saints,3,1574618231,e11i7g
5771,"Man, you Panthers fans are way more down on yourselves than I am. I will never underestimate a divisional team again after that Falcons game.",Saints,6,1574618158,e11i7g
5772,Tony Romo has a good enough jaw to play batman,Panthers,3,1574618105,e11i7g
5773,I'm not opposed to that but what good would it do. He's probably worse than Allen so we'd just talk about how shitty he is instead of Allen. If for some reason cam doesnt come back (I think he will) we should roster like 5 Qbs no one has heard of so by the time teams get enough tape one one and start to figure them out we pop a new one in there,Panthers,1,1574618039,e11i7g
5774,Do we have to?,Panthers,2,1574618009,e11i7g
5775,Hopefully we can still fuck up the Saint's playoff seed.  Let's do this thing cats.,Panthers,1,1574617937,e11i7g
5776,"I have Fox, but it's almost always an NFC East game where I live. I otherwise just stream illegally. We could have had a third one against an NFC team... I can't remember though.",Panthers,1,1574617935,e11i7g
5777,Ok I thought we already had one against another nfc team but I guess not. Are you not able to watch games on fox?,Panthers,1,1574617884,e11i7g
5778,"Yes, against both Jacksonville and Tennessee. I remember this because I was able to watch them on network TV.",Panthers,1,1574617488,e11i7g
5779,Didn't we already have a cbs game,Panthers,7,1574617365,e11i7g
5780,How are the Saints *only* -9.5 favorites today?,Panthers,3,1574617364,e11i7g
5781,Kyle Allen is worse than Matt Ryan,,3,1574617342,e11i7g
5782,I think the falcons just figured out how to play defense. That's who destroyed us last week,Panthers,4,1574617336,e11i7g
5783,SHOW ME YOUR WILL GRIER!!!!!,Panthers,1,1574617330,e11i7g

5789,"I know we're guaranteed to lose this game, and am already looking to next week, but hopefully we put up more of a fight today than last week.

I can't find myself believing this team is as a pathetic shitshow as it was last week.",Panthers,5,1574616988,e11i7g
5790,Lets have a healthy game today fellas,Saints,3,1574616783,e11i7g
5791,Let's show them we can get in the end zone and not use CMC and not convert on 4th down rather than throwing an interception,Panthers,3,1574616726,e11i7g
