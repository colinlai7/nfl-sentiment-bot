&gt; backward, the ball is declared dead, and forward progress is awarded at the spot where initial contact by the opponent was
&gt; made after the player established firm grip and control of the ball while in the air

He's a rookie so it's not a big deal but don't compare Jerry rice playing in an era where there can still touch recievers down field to today's. It's the same thing as ppl comparing Peyton Manning and tom Brady first int to Jimmy's. we expect better in 2019 because the game has changed to make it easier.
