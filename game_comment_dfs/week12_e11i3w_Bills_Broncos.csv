1136,"A couple of my black coworkers say their parents watch it religiously.  Anecdotal I know but it's a data point.  I think a lot of TV is marketed to 50 year olds now, people my age don't watch live TV anymore.  I'm 30.",Bills,5,1574620407,e11i3w

1139,I agree that they could have called a penalty for RTP there but Risner did more than just fall. He purposefully dropped on a defender after the defender was blocked into the ground. He's a young player and it was just a lapse in judgement so no harm no foul but god forbid if he hurt someone doing that it'd be a problem.,Bills,1,1574620388,e11i3w

1142,Not if it's Brandon Allen apparently. If that was Brady they would've ended the game right there,Bills,5,1574620356,e11i3w
