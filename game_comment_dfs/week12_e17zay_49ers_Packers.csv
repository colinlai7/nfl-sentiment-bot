28,"As Rodgers gained more control over the offense from 2011-2014, you saw him develop a particular kind of playstyle. He eschewed the quick passing game that had been the hallmark of MM's offense. He eschewed the fairly even run-pass ration that MM always preached (sometimes MM preached this to a fault). Instead of operating within the context of the offense, including operating on a rhythm and executing plays as called, he started relying on what came to be his hallmark: the scramble drill.

This happened over time, but eventually the offense came to pretty  reliant on these scramble drills, culminating in 2016-18. Rodgers wasn't operating within an offense, he was holding onto the ball, ignoring checkdown routes and short routes in constant hopes of hitting the deep ball. He'd check out of run plays even when the box was light. 

For a while this worked. It worked when Rodgers wasn't doing it every play. It worked when the receiving corps was very good. It worked when the o-line was giving him a million years. It worked when Rodgers could actually throw accurate passes. But primarily it worked when it wasn't the only thing Rodgers did.

But he's been playing this style of offense for almost a decade now.  He's played it under MM, Philbin, and MLF. He's done it under several OCs. He's done it regardless of the players around him. It got blamed on MM but persisted when MM was gone. MLF was supposed to introduce a new style of offense but it's still happening. 

If this style of offense sticks around despite all the turnover, it's probably on the shoulders of the one person who's been the constant throughout all of this.

Rodgers has not had a whole elite season since 2014. He had half an elite season in 2016. He had an elite stretch in 2017 before getting hurt. Since then he's only had a couple elite games since then. He's only taken over a couple games in the way he used to be able to take over consistently. Rodgers isn't on the decline. Rodgers has declined.",Packers,1,1574708739,e17zay

8893,"I could ask you the same question.

Here are 3 scenarios:

A) Player jumps to catch football - has control.  Lands 2 feet (inbound) - and starts running, takes 2 more steps, gets tackled.  As he gets tackled, he maintains control, and as he hits the ground, loses control.

A ruling: It's a valid catch, down by contact where he got tacked.  I hope you agree with this one...it's a pure pass caught, where receiver then gets tacked after x amounts of steps.

B) Player jumps to catch football - has control.  Lands 2 feet (inbound) - but as he lands, gets tackled.  As he gets tackled, he maintains control, and as he hits the ground, loses control.

B ruling: It's not a catch - player didn't complete the catch before being tacked/hitting ground, and he has to complete it...that's the rule you quoted.

C) Player jumps to catch football - has control.  Lands 2 feed (inbound) - then makes a football move while having control of the football (stretches for goal line or takes a 3rd step) - then hits the ground and loses football.

C ruling: It's a a catch...That's essentially the new catch rule - ie: the Dez rule.  Or the same thing that happened in the Steelers vs Patriots in 2017  with Jesse James where he stretched for the goal line, and lost control as it hit the ground.  This is now a catch.

So the question really is - did he take a 3rd step before losing control when he hit the ground?  ie: is it B or C?",Patriots,1,1574652234,e17zay

13800,"Rule 8, Section 1, Article 3, Item 1,"" A player is considered to be going to the ground if he does not remain upright long enough to demonstrate that he is clearly a runner. If a player goes to the ground in the act of catching a pass (with or without contact by an opponent), he must maintain control of the ball until after his initial contact with the ground, whether in the field of play or the end zone. If he loses control of the ball, and the ball touches the ground before he regains control, the pass is incomplete.""

Turkey is a kitchen casualty in its culinary execution in far too many American kitchens this holiday season.

Spending thanksgiving solo so I decided to make my knee-weakening BBQ pulled pork (DM if you want the recipe) baked beans, home-made rolls and mashed potatoes with pickles as a palette cleanser and pumpkin pie for a delayed dessert. 2 cases of beer should do the job for the afternoon of football. I have some crackers and a half-pound block of Horseradish cheddar if I have a hankering for more in the evening.
