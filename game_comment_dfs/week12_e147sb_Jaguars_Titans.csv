But with Ryan, he now has the opportunity to call plays where the offense is giving him plenty of options to work with. Now, our play action is working early in the game, which opens up the run game for Henry. Teams would literally just sit their defensive backs 10 yards out every single play against Marcus because they knew he couldn't throw the ball much farther than that range; now, the DBs actually have to cover the field, because Ryan will make them pay with a dime if they give him the chance.
