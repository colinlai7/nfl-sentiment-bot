It also doesn't help that it's 11 on 11 all the time - attributing any play's result to an individual is really hard. When a baseball player hits a home run, either he did something really right or the pitcher did something really wrong. When a running back busts it for 25, was it him? was it the offensive line? was it a bad play call? was it (in Baltimore's case) that the defense is too afraid of the quarterback to stack the box?

There are other things I didn't mention about excelling in a Zone Blocking scheme, but those two are certainly key features.

Zone Blocking isn't as immediately, visually obvious when looking at it - it's more of a 'bigger picture' look at the blocking (ex: assuming and anticipating where things *will* be). 

When you're actually playing though honestly I always felt like it was intuitive where you could see, or really, 'feel' where and how things were going to flow. Who was going to slide into who, and be engaged with them (a moment later, a few moments later, etc), and how leverage was going to look as far as your options were concerned. Only now, later, do I realize how much was just naturally processed, and so quickly. Plays don't even last that long, lol.

- Fire crack-head eyed Gase, Lure name value for FO repleneshing who care about winning and not media-market boot-licking (which is counter-productive to winning actual games).

- This is counter-intuitive, but **impose an ownership-mandated media lockout** for 4 years in New York. I know press lives off of access, but you have zero control over the distractions potentially fed to your active players that the media has no right to speak/possibly influence themselves as a bunch of skinny/fat dockers khakis who never played a spot in their lives..

- Win a division title over a BB/Brady Patriots team; then, have the most meaningful outlets BID $$$ for access for your franchise again.

- Jets are currently a laughing-stock/free press thing to trash now. This would turn the tables and only real ones would stick with that paradigm (as it always shouldve been)

- Win a division title over a BB/Brady Patriots team; then, have the most meaningful outlets BID access for your franchise again.

- Win a division title over a BB/Brady Patriots team; then, have the most meaningful outlets BID access for your franchise again.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A Raven is a Raven and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a Raven is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call The Blue Jays, The Ravens, and other bird teams The Crows, too.

This offense and the direction this organization has taken is remarkable. It's a fairly reasonable for a team to say ""we run pocket passing offense. All of our staff knows pocket passing offense. Nobody in this organization understands how to run anything other than pocket passing offense.""

The situation in Baltimore is special - both in terms of the QB and the organization. The QB can't do it himself, and it is legitimate for an organization to say 'our personnel can't do this style; we'd fuck it up.'",Chiefs,1,1576200937,e9wixd
