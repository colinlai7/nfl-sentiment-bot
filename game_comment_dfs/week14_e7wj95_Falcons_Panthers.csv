385,Eric Reid is quite possibly the worst tackler in NFL history.,Panthers,-1,1575829289,e7wj95
386,We called it first. No take backs.,Falcons,3,1575829257,e7wj95

432,I’m gonna hate the outcome of this game no matter what. I think my best case scenario is we dominate the game but get robbed by reffing and don’t sacrifice any draft position,Panthers,2,1575828191,e7wj95
433,"I hope everybody plays their hardest but we're going into a rebuild so that pick would be sweet.

But I still hope we win cause I like winning",Panthers,1,1575828172,e7wj95
