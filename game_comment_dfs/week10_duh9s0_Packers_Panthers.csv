5,Lol dude I articulated five different times why it's better to go for two the second time. Additionally I think blowing a pass from the two and a run from the two the same quarter pretty well illustrates the point that they were not doing well from there.,Cowboys,1,1573575093,duh9s0

8,"While that did prevent Carolina the chance to score, it also came after Green Bay had a drive stopped due to an equally egregious offensive PI call. You could say with how the packers were moving the ball they most likely get 3 points and probably 7 as the only reason the drive at the end of the half fell short was because of the time. 

Had both plays been called correctly, I think the teams go into the half with the same differential.",Packers,1,1573515199,duh9s0
9,Late response. Sorry. The roughing the passer call cost CAR a shot to go get some points at a point in the game where they were moving the ball really well. Odds are CAR goes into the half with the score 14-13 or even 17-13.,,1,1573514671,duh9s0

15,Exactly. That's why it's so frustrating for Packers fans try to tell us he's our future after a heartbreaking loss like that. It's patronizing and incorrect. Then when we point that out we get talked down to like they know our QB situation better than we do. I've watched every game he's played and I don't see it.,Panthers,1,1573501165,duh9s0
16,"&gt;How is the risk of one play to win worse than the risk of needing two additional field goals or the exact same risk just to tie cause you missed the first one.

Your chance of making one successful two point conversion given two opportunities is roughly equal to making two successful PATs. Given the weather conditions of the game, it was likely higher.

Given this likelihood, it's highly unlikely that you fail to convert either two point conversion.

However, the odds change if you only go for one two point conversion. The odds of successfully converting a single two point conversion is a tad under 50%. 

So let's review. Given two opportunities of converting a two point conversion, you will be almost guaranteed of doing no worse than kicking both PATs. Given one opportunity of converting a two point conversion, you have under a 50% of making it. Therefore, the risk of losing goes up greatly if you only have one chance of making the two point conversion.

Additionally, if you make the first two point conversion, you can tie the game with two FGs.

In short, going for the two point conversion on the first TD lets you hedge your bets. It also lets you get away with not getting another TD without losing.",Packers,1,1573500864,duh9s0
17,"How is the risk of one play to win worse than the risk of needing two additional field goals or the exact same risk just to tie cause you missed the first one.

765,"it makes sense when you think of it this way: the end result of the game is all that matters so you do everything you can to win the game. going for two when down by 1 as opposed to going for two when down by 8 means it all rides on that singular TPC. 50% chance of a win and 50% chance of a loss. 

but if you score a touchdown when down by 14 and go for two, you either convert it and set yourself up for a win (assuming you score again) with a normal extra point, but if you don‚Äôt convert then you are not totally out of the game like you are if you fail to convert when down by 1. you still have an opportunity to tie the game and send it to overtime and win in OT. so it just gives more scenarios where your team wins, which obviously means you minimize your chances of losing. 

sorry if i‚Äôm rambling but i just find it super interesting to think about how these decisions seem just stupid to the eye, but logically it makes perfect sense.",,1,1573432879,duh9s0

At first I was kind nervous and freaked out, I'd just kinda glance at him every now and then, trying not to freak him out. But then my fucking niece starts crying and fidgeting and shit and won't shut up. So I'm trying to keep my niece quiet and not bother Rodgers, when oops, too late, he gets up and walks over to us. He just smiled and stroked her hair, and asked me what was wrong. I said I didn't know.
