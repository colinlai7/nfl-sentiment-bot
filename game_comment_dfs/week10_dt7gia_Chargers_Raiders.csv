I just think about how Brees and Sean Payton (and to be fair, just about ANY DECENT TEAM) would have handled the situation.  Easy 10 yard outs, with a few short passes up the middle mixed in since you have THREE TIME OUTS.  It would have been a joke to get into FG range even with that pass rush.

Also the jawing yeah it's annoying at times but I like it, he's a competitor and when Brady does it no one complains they just say ""Oh man look how great of a competitor he is"".

I shit my pants.

It's okay I'll just use my nice Jersey I purchased from the NFL online store to wipe. I'm saving too much money from my Progressive Insurance and freephonefootball to worry.

Then he made the hotel a character, and decided to let it live, killing Jack instead when he couldn’t give the hotel his son through murder. Makes Jack the subordinate, which he is, compared to an old hotel. King made the hotel a character, but made the hotel work through Jack as an equal, like Jack had a bit of humanity left at the end, which confuses the blow up of his sanity via the boiler as a metaphor and as a way to kill the hotel. I was never a fan of the boiler-metaphor story arch. But all the snow entering the hotel, the hotel surrounded by it, Jack in the freezer, to me that’s menacing as fuck, feels inhuman.

Personally, I think only Rob Reiner has been successful translating King to the big screen (Stand by Me, Misery) and whomever did the mini-series in the 90s of The Stand did a great job as well with the money they had. Kubrick seemed to not really understand the novel. Jack Nicholson was the exact opposite of the type of person who should have played Jack. Contemporary actors that would have been better would be like Gene Hackman or Albert Finney, someone that is not menacing and creepy from the start. The book is about a man's slow dive into madness because the hotel is haunting him, and Kubrick's film just doesn't grasp that.

8322,"There are a lot of people in this thread that do not understand what offsides is. This is the definition from the rulebook:

&gt;ARTICLE 5. OFFSIDE  
A player is offside when any part of his body is in or beyond the neutral zone or beyond a restraining line when the ball is put in play.

Lining up in the neutral zone is not a neutral zone infraction, it is offside, by definition.

A neutral zone infraction, on the other hand:

&gt;ARTICLE 4. NEUTRAL ZONE INFRACTION  
It is a Neutral Zone Infraction when:

1. a defender moves beyond the neutral zone prior to the snap and is parallel to or beyond an offensive lineman, with an unimpeded path to the quarterback or kicker, even though no contact is made by a blocker; officials are to blow their whistles immediately  
2. a defender enters the neutral zone prior to the snap, causing the offensive player(s) in close proximity (including a quarterback who is under center) to react (move) immediately to protect himself (themselves) against impending contact; officials are to blow their whistles immediately. If there is no immediate reaction by the offensive player(s) in close proximity, and the defensive player returns to a legal position prior to the snap without contacting an opponent, there is no foul. A flexed or split receiver is considered to be in close proximity if he is lined up on the side of the ball on which the violation occurs; other offensive players are considered to be in close proximity if they are within two-and-one-half positions of the defender who enters the neutral zone. If the defender is directly over the center, a quarterback under center, the center, and the guards and tackles on both sides of the center are considered to be within close proximity; if the defender is in a gap, the two offensive players on either side of the gap are considered to be within close proximity (including a quarterback under center, if applicable)  
3. a player, after he has received a warning, enters the neutral zone. It is a foul, even if he returns to a legal position prior to the snap without contacting an opponent or causing a reaction (movement) by an offensive player in close proximity.",Cardinals,1,1573180733,dt7gia

The problem was the contact while the ball was in the air, specifically using his arms and body to prevent the receiver from getting position. If he had just held his ground, like he was setting a pick in basketball, he'd be legal. Because he kept moving and attempting to physically impede or manipulate the receiver while the ball was in the air, it was defensive pass interference.
