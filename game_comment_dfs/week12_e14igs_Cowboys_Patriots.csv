13,"I think it's too early to say.  It depends on what he and the other candidates (and especially Lamar Jackson, since he's the frontrunner) do between now and the end of the season.  

Jackson might up and run away with it if he keeps turning in spectacular games.  But if he doesn't, and Dak does, then there's potential for Dak to pick up votes.

Hes out. That's it. I'll bet you 10 billion fucking dollars he doesnt win it. Idk how you can argue for it right now. There is a 0% chance that dak wins the MVP at this point.

i have no idea why people like you hate him so much he's done a great job with the cowboys during his time there.

he was a coordinator and then he got promoted to HC and he's done well in that role.    how much experience you think he should have doesn't really matter.

At any rate, Dak has very little to do with why the Cowboys lost this game.  Terrible special teams played a much bigger role.

1. Blocked punt leads to Patriots' only touchdown.
2. Punt team not having been coached on what to do if nobody is out there to return the punt leads to stupid penalty and 20 yards of lost field position.
3. Kickoff return team completely failing to account for wind  which has been a major factor all game long, leads to offense having much farther to go on the final drive than they should have.

Of course, Garrett gets his own part of the blame for calling for a field goal when only a touchdown would do.  At that point, they'd have been better off going for it on 4th and 7; even if they didn't convert, they'd have been giving the Patriots worse field position, and they'd *still need a touchdown* just like they did *with* the field goal!

You can't really look at sports like soccer/basketball and then compare them to football because there isn't really much surrounding the act of possessing the ball in those games. Like, it doesn't matter if the ball gets stolen in basketball or soccer, or if it switches back and forth several times. Unless a player touches the ball while out of bounds there's no stoppage of play, so the act of actually possessing the ball means very little within the context of the game. 

Conversely, possessing the football is extremely important in football, since if your knee/elbow/etc hit the ground after touching a defender while you possess the ball, play stops and the ball is placed there.
