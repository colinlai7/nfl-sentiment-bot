3,That’s not what pretty much everyone is saying in the highlight (lowlight) thread.,Redskins,1,1575336304,e4kgcq
4,He never lowered his helmet - what BS is this?,Panthers,1,1575334253,e4kgcq
5,Hard my to do when you have no idea when the runner is gonna hunch over. Also to my point you can watch interview after interview of players talking about how hard this very thing is to do because how fast things happens.,Panthers,1,1575252673,e4kgcq
6,They teach heads up tackling.,Panthers,1,1575252389,e4kgcq
7,So how do you tackle then If you can’t get as low as the defender? We have all seen trying to tackle the upper body defender will just bounce off. So how are they supposed to tackle when the runner lowers their head and body?,Panthers,1,1575251877,e4kgcq
8,"They're not protecting the ball though, so I don't think it's the same. As a ball carrier, when you hunker down like that you're kind of shielding the ball in your chest. You also have at least one less arm involved in bracing yourself because it's holding the ball. The defender, obviously, doesn't have to tuck the ball away when they're making the tackle.",Panthers,1,1575251720,e4kgcq

15,I’ won’t pretend to know what you have seen.  That’s horrible.  And I’m glad I haven’t had to see it. People can be trash.  I hate fans of my team can be that.,Panthers,1,1575236566,e4kgcq

17,"Neutral nfl fan here - The Panthers have to get rid of Ron. His inability to scheme against THIS Washington team as well as failure to motivate is such an encapsulation of his time in Carolina.

He had one good year that just so happened to coincide with Cam having a transcendent year. 

He has been coasting on that and a cool nickname for too long. This dude is fraud, year in and year out. 

Carolina - I hope you get a real coach that understands how to game plan with the talent you all have.",,6,1575236462,e4kgcq
18,So did the panthers Dline,,2,1575236459,e4kgcq
19,I know lots of people that have pretty uncool views about certain people at certain positions. There are a good handfull of people who have asked for a white QB for a while. It's trashy as fuck and really quite sad but that's just the reality of it. Some people are just garbage.,Panthers,1,1575236450,e4kgcq
20,"Panthers score to get within 8, convert the onside kick because nobody from Washington was anywhere close to the ball for some reason, then drive down to the one-yard line. CMC loses yards going up the middle twice, Allen almost throws a pick, then on 4th down Allen has a clean pocket but panics, runs 20 yards backwards and gets sacked",Eagles,2,1575236398,e4kgcq
21,I don’t think that. And that’s the problem,,1,1575236329,e4kgcq
22,Panthers score. Panthers onside kick recovered. Panthers to the 1 yard line. Goal line stand by redskins.,Redskins,1,1575236307,e4kgcq
23,"Panthers drive with a TD to DJ Moore, go for the onside kick and recover it! Again drive down the field primarily with DJ Moore, get the ball to the 1 yard line for first and goal. Hand the ball off to McCaffrey twice, both times for a loss of a yard. 3rd and 3, Allen threw to Moore in the endzone and almost intercepted, but incomplete. 4th down from the 3 down 21-28, Allen doesn't see the wide open receiver and tries to scramble, but is sacked and fumbles the ball to turn it over. Panthers lose 21-28",Seahawks,2,1575236304,e4kgcq
24,Not many people wanted to get rid of him. It was a total media creation.,Panthers,3,1575236294,e4kgcq
25,Allen isnt the best. But I hope we keep him. He could end up complimenting Cam well if he improves. Also if we get a better OC in the offseason. Hopefully,Panthers,1,1575236282,e4kgcq
