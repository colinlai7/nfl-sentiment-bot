Ciri I think fits the youthful part as far as the books; I'm really curious how they're gonna handle her when she [spoilers! don't read the rest if you don't want to see any] is supposed to wield swords as well and as lethally as Geralt does, because she's a super skinny actress.

The only casting issue I have is Fringilla; in the books she's supposed to resemble Yen, and that's part of why Geralt is so attracted to her when they hook up for an extended period of time. But she does not resemble Yen at all in the show.",Patriots,1,1576442438,eb1qxn

3320,"I honestly think this will be a more competitive game than most people think. Not saying we’ll win but a large portion of our losses are one possession with one or two plays making the difference. And a lot of those are against teams that are either playoff teams or in the hunt. 

Not saying that trying to act like it’s something to be proud of because at the end of the day a loss is a loss no matter the score. Just saying that generally we play close games and then manage to throw it away late. So it wouldn’t shock me if this game ends up being somewhat close.",Bengals,2,1576431431,eb1qxn
