64,"Eli still has value as a mentor. Help develop Jones. Dudes a 2x SB winning QB. His knowledge is incredibly valuable for a rookie QB. Saquon is still young and a centerpiece to that offense. The playcalling is very obviously underwhelming. Their OLine is getting better compared to previous years. Evan Engram, Sterling Shepard and Saquon are enough offensive weapons to help develop Jones with. They just need a capable defense and to continue developing Jones. Maybe another 2 years before the offense starts recognizing its potential. I’m sure the Giants FO recognizes these things and are limiting the touches Saquon receives to preserve him.",,1,1572933911,drraz8

6771,"The most likely scenario here is that the ref throwing the flag did so based on a judgement that whatever was said was intended to provoke the opponent.

The reason it seems like it was triggered by the shove is likely because the ref was probably just going to let it go until it provoked a reaction and forced him to throw a flag on the guy who, ""started it.""

Not saying I agree with the flag only being on the taunter (especially only after it successfully provoked the opponent) and not offset by the retaliation, however at the NFL level, shoving is rarely, if ever, flagged so it at least remains consistent.

But every team has a WR1 who gets the most targets per game. Every now and then the WR2 will steal the show but the WR1 will still remain.
