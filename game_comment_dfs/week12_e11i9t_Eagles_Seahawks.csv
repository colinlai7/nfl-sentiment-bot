With that said, Wentz has looked awful and isn't doing much to elevate his team. In this game alone he's wiffed on easy passes, fumbled, and threw an ill-advised interception. 

There's a lot of issues in the locker room that show dysfunction in the organization and leadership. This has been leaked many times through the season and if even half of it is true, it shows issues all around.

The coaching doesn't seem to be doing anything to elevate their WRs and CBs. They've shown very little to nothing in progression, and I've gotta imagine that their coaches are not doing enough at these two positional groups. 

Lastly, there's a reason why this team is left with mediocre players starting, because the genius that is Howie Roseman and the scouting department can not draft to save their lives and have made moves that are looking worse as time goes on. They brought in a 32 year old Desean Jackson as their answer to the WR corp. A guy who hasn't played a full 16 game season since 2013, though admittedly he played 15 games in 2016. They brought in Alshon Jeffrey, another injury prone WR as their WR1 answer, and now they're starting nobodies.
