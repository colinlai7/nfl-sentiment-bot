You aren’t making the playoff and Jones still gets a great amount of experience this season.Honestly, if you’re the Giants why not do this? You aren’t making the playoff and Jones still gets a great amount of experience this season.Okay so here’s how the rest of the season plays out. Jones leads the giants to a 9-7 record but gets mono from kissing so many hot babes at the party to celebrate clinching the wild card. Eli steps in and uses his autism to do what he does best: lead the giants on a ridiculous playoff run. He then faces off against the 18-0 patriots in the super bowl. Before the game Daniel Jones pretends to be Brady’s son and kisses him, giving Brady mono. In the 4th quarter Eli uses his lumpy body to avoid a sure sack, and puts absolutely everything he has into a wobbly 22 yard td pass on 4th and 11 to golden Tate. His arm literally falls off but the giants go up 17-14. Brady comes onto the field but he’s starting to feel the effects of that sultry Daniel Jones kiss. Without any time outs left, he throws an out route to AB, who was completely uncovered because the giants secondary forgot the forward pass was allowed, but he trips 5 yards from the end zone while celebrating because his new helmet limited his field of vision and he couldn’t see his shoe was untied. Brady tries to sprint the length of the field but finally succumbs to his mono, choking to death in a puddle of his own vomit. The clock hits zero, and the prophecy of 3li is finally complete. Belichick commits seppuku as Eli is named Super bowl MVP for the third time, and Eli passes the Lombardi trophy to Daniel Jones, who will go on to begin a new era of domination that the world has never seen.Okay so here’s how the rest of the season plays out.

Super Bowl 42 was the first football game I ever watched. It left a big impression on me when I was seven. I started watching regularly a couple seasons later, and always had a great time seeing this guy out there. Even when we were losing, he was the one constant who tied me to those memories. Today is a sad day for me, even if it had to be done.Posted this is r/NYGiants but I'm gonna say it here too.

In the Wildcard Round he beats the 12-4 Cowboys, he then proceeds to lift the Giants over the 15-1 Packers with the rejuvenated MVP Aaron Rodgers and manages to win a close game in OT against the 49ers and COTY Shannahan.

It's the 4th Quarter of the Super Bowl. Giants have the Ball at the 50 with one second left on the clock against the 18-0 Patriots. Jones escapes 3 men, close his eyes and throws one up that is caught miraculously by Shepard in the Endzone. Touchdown Giants. Game is over and the Celebrations begin.
