2003-2007 for reference. Definitely not good years to be a lions coach.

I mean there aren't very many good years to be a lions coach, but those years especially.Well fuck. He got us*Adds Jets to the list of hated teams*

*Sees they already on the list*That's fairGase called for unnecessary roughness.Not since Cecil has a lion been so unnecessarily killedDamn Detroit somehow taking the worst of that 23 point spread.Lions is that upset woman meme. Gase is the cat.Damn man

Just unnecessary lol I like the LionsGase left Detroit before their 0-16 season, but even in 2008 their worst spread was 17 points (@ Indy late in the year).  So this is probably the biggest spread of his career.Jets and Dolphin fans are right, fuck gaseWhen the fuck was he in Detroit?This little bitchI feel that on a personal level. Fuck you gase.Wow, that's some serious Splash DamageYou know what, fuck you too buddy.Ahahahahar/murderedbywordsThat kind of insult may affect Detroit’s spread.adam gase bragging about being awful throughout his professional coaching career.

&#x200B;

is there any way this guy actually makes it past year one for the jets? darnold would have to come back and save his ass, it seems.This brings up a point hopefully someone can enlighten me on. Has Gase every been successful? I know he was Peyton's OC in Denver, but Peyton famously completely runs the offense. He calls all the plays at the line, so im not giving the OC much credit. He SUCKED in Miami, he called himself out for sucking in Detroit. His tenure with the Jets has not been good. How does this guy keep getting work?Say what you will, this dude is fucking hilariousI don’t like Gase and I’m glad his form of punishment is coaching the Jets"You have to remember, failure has been a big part of my career."Boom. Roasted.Trash.Fucking ruthless.I understand now, that's why we were so bad.Gase is trash why is he taking shots at detroit lmaoThis POS. You also coached in Miami and with the Jets. Every team u coach is ass.Damn, the record for biggest spread in the NFL is 23 points. That was during the 1987 strike. This spread is gonna top it before long.I feel this is not ok when you are 0-2 and 23 point underdogs. Just points out the fact that he is always coaching shit teams-___-  

[That is true.  That is also true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPWwCRHF9UU)fuckThrew so much shade it’s below freezing in Detroit.I still don’t understand how this guy got hired as a head coach again, let alone in the same fucking division. How fucking stupid are the Jets? We need you to beat the Patriots and Adam Gase is what you came up with????I can see it now. Patriots up 6 points, 1:30 left in the game, Jets have the ball. its 3rd and 8 and the ball is on the NE 42. Draw play for no gain.BOOM ROASTEDDDDDDDDDI used to be an offense related assistant coach on the Lions (there are dozens of assist nobody's on NFL teams) Joe Lombardi would never talk to us during the week but would ask me and the guys for input during games that we were putting up low numbers in.  One game right after the grounds crew switched to blue outfits he got them confused with the assistant coach pool and started asking the guy who was responsible for emergency field repair for play calling advice. We didn't score a lot of points that game.as punishment the people of Detroit will retaliate by taking him to ...…… DetroitWhy does Gase always deflect the issues with his team to something else?Lions taking L's even when they're not playing, goddamn. You hate to see it.OuchheySavageCould explain why we had 5 losing seasons with him running the offense.Low blow.I don't think he's that good a coach but this was a HOF burn.Adam Gase is constantly frying other teams when his current team is always the one that needs the most workGlass houses, Adam. Jesus Christ.Well he is probably not wrong.

But now I am going to blame our ineptitude on hiring choices like him.Is that a self burn?https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2Fcbea668a89a141c4b8b099535d782deb%2F960x0.jpg"Probably, this kind of thing just seems to follow me around"/r/suicidebywordsFuck Adam GaseWell that explains a lot about Adam...wow. wtf bro.I mean, he's taking a shot at the Lions but this is also a self burn.hey we have families ass hole!The real question is will they win a single game this year.FWIW, the Lions were 17-point underdogs once in 2009 and once in 2008.  Those are the 2 biggest spreads they have ever faced.  (They pushed one and covered one.)>Scouting assistant from 2003-2004

Yeah sure Gase, you "coached" for 5 yearsAdam *"all the teams I coached are bad"* Gase.Shots fired.  Fuck you Gase!Manning got this man paidSPOILER ALERT: Lions have **never** been that big of an underdog, including their 0-16 season.AFC East somehow getting worse lol...even easier division crown for NE nowAbsolutely barbaricWhy a rugged schedule for the Pats thus far. Hope it all works out for them./u/NiceLeadYouHaveThere I was nicer than GaseAdam Gase in Detroit:

Scouting Assistant 2003-2005

Offensive Assistant 2006-2007

3-13; 7-9. 32% win percentage as a Lions assistant coach

Head Coaching Record: 23-28 (including playoffs) for the Dolphins and Jets

45% win percentage.

Cool GaseI know it is the Jets and the Pats but holy fuck. A 23 point spread? That's got the be one of the biggest ever.
