Ben down

Eli down

last one standing PhillipEnd of an eraThe last chapter in the Book of Eli.2019 is the year of the backup QB2019 is the year the Mid 2000's QB's dieThe old guard is slowing fading away**OH SHIT**.His final career stats (assuming he never plays again): 116-116.

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

Edit: these are his regular season W/L record, not counting postseason.Daniel Jones leads them to a 14-2 finish.

Eli comes in to defeat New England in the Super Bowl for old time's sake.Rip 3li[eli waking up to the news](https://dailysnark.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BwO9s4RCEAA5dG5-500x240.png)

good bye manning face, lets all agree its over now.Honestly, if you‚Äôre the Giants why not do this? You aren‚Äôt making the playoff and Jones still gets a great amount of experience this season.Okay so here‚Äôs how the rest of the season plays out. Jones leads the giants to a 9-7 record but gets mono from kissing so many hot babes at the party to celebrate clinching the wild card. Eli steps in and uses his autism to do what he does best: lead the giants on a ridiculous playoff run. He then faces off against the 18-0 patriots in the super bowl. Before the game Daniel Jones pretends to be Brady‚Äôs son and kisses him, giving Brady mono. In the 4th quarter Eli uses his lumpy body to avoid a sure sack, and puts absolutely everything he has into a wobbly 22 yard td pass on 4th and 11 to golden Tate. His arm literally falls off but the giants go up 17-14. Brady comes onto the field but he‚Äôs starting to feel the effects of that sultry Daniel Jones kiss. Without any time outs left, he throws an out route to AB, who was completely uncovered because the giants secondary forgot the forward pass was allowed, but he trips 5 yards from the end zone while celebrating because his new helmet limited his field of vision and he couldn‚Äôt see his shoe was untied. Brady tries to sprint the length of the field but finally succumbs to his mono, choking to death in a puddle of his own vomit. The clock hits zero, and the prophecy of 3li is finally complete. Belichick commits seppuku as Eli is named Super bowl MVP for the third time, and Eli passes the Lombardi trophy to Daniel Jones, who will go on to begin a new era of domination that the world has never seen.Brees out Eli out and Big ben out, never thought id see the dayI feel like they‚Äôre throwing him into the fire too quickly but I also really want to see him play.Thank you Eli for stopping the Pats 2xWeek 3? That didn't take long.If this is the end for Eli, maybe the Giants should trade him to the Chargers as a backup. Career ends where it began. I wish Eli would've retired in the off season. Hate to see him go out like this, but it is time for a change.All memes in here but I will always love Eli, favorite Giant ever. Now it‚Äôs Danny Dimes timeLot earlier than I expected honestlyBuffalo adds Eli Manning to the pile of NY QBs whose NY career they ended, with Sanchez, Geno, and Mike Vick.FUCK YES!

UNLEASH DANIEL JONES.

NFCE CHAMPIONS.

YOU WILL BOW BEFORE THE METOPHORICAL GOD HIMSELF.  DANIEL "DANIEL JONES" JONES.

WE ARE ALL WITNESSES.Unless he plays again, doesn't he end his career with as many wins as losses as a starter?To stop me from being sad I now require Eli Manning and Tony Romo to call games together. plsCan‚Äôt wait to really see how fucking poorly this team has been mismanaged now that two time Super Bowl champion and scapegoat Eli Manning is out. Guy never complained once. I‚Äôm going to miss EliRIP 3li, Brees, BenIts been real, Elisha. Now he‚Äôs check downing in that big blue sky.

**EDIT** Should Jones be called DannyJ or Daniel Stephen Jones? I now have to think of a disrespectful name for a new QB!End of an eraNot a good week for the 04 QBs.Week to week my assOh, shit! Jones is offiically the second 2019 draft QB domino to fall into place. I wish him luck. Hopefully he can prove the doubters wrong. Much luck, Mr. Jones. Much luck.Posted this is r/NYGiants but I'm gonna say it here too.

Super Bowl 42 was the first football game I ever watched. It left a big impression on me when I was seven. I started watching regularly a couple seasons later, and always had a great time seeing this guy out there. Even when we were losing, he was the one constant who tied me to those memories. Today is a sad day for me, even if it had to be done.It's all coming together now. I already see it in front of my eyes. After a rough start to his NFL career Daniel Jones leads the Giants to 9-7 and the last Wildcard spot. In the Wildcard Round he beats the 12-4 Cowboys, he then proceeds to lift the Giants over the 15-1 Packers with the rejuvenated MVP Aaron Rodgers and manages to win a close game in OT against the 49ers and COTY Shannahan.

It's the 4th Quarter of the Super Bowl. Giants have the Ball at the 50 with one second left on the clock against the 18-0 Patriots. Jones escapes 3 men, close his eyes and throws one up that is caught miraculously by Shepard in the Endzone. Touchdown Giants. Game is over and the Celebrations begin.
Patriots 48 Giants 7Gonna say this to Giants fans in advance. Don't get too excited when he massacres the Bucs. We are famous for letting backups murder us.That‚Äôs a lot sooner than I thoughtRest in piece Eli Manning.  
3rd of the Manning name.  
Slayer of the Patriots.  
Average Joe of the Big Apple.  
King of the "wtf just happened" face.Eli doesn't want to go under .500Luke Falk and Daniel Jones will be the starting QBs in NY this week. Just like we all thought.End of an 3raWould probably be better to start him when his receivers are back but I like the move. Eli is done and Shurmur wants to keep his job.They did it oh shitThank you, Eli. Flags fly forever.We're still not going to win many games because our defense is trash, but this is super exciting and sad all at the same time. I'm freaking out!We are gonna get shredded aren't we...The Giants organization really wasted Eli's career towards the end. 

**Fuck Jerry Reese**. Even when he posted some of his best QBR, the Giants were 6-10 due to poor secondary, aging pass rushers, noooooo quality Tight End, and a deteriorating OL that were poorly addressed.Daniel Jones leads the giants to 14-2. His awe inspiring presence galvanizes the defense. Lorenzo Carter reveals in a press conference his real name is Lawerence Taylor Jr and he assumes the powers of his father. The giants make it to the super bowl against the 18-0 Pats. Daniel Jones is decapitated by a deranged Antonio Brown wielding a battle axe. Eli comes in and defeats Brady and Belichick for the third time. Fulfilling the prophecy, Belichick and Brady are both trapped in phantom zone for eternity, due to their deal with the devil that makes them immortal. The country rejoices.This season is showing me that I‚Äôm getting old. So many QBs I grew up watching are getting hurt or benched and there‚Äôs that motherfucker in NE who won‚Äôt fuck offBetter hope he‚Äôs actually ready, or the giants may end up killing him like the Browns did so many QBs before.‚ÄúEli Manning officially changes his legal name to Daniel Jones.  QB controversy is far from over.‚ÄùTrade him to Pittsburgh. The Mara connection. The Eli/Big Ben connection.  

Eli steps in for his rival, beats the undefeated Patriots in the AFC championship game and leads Pittsburgh to the title completing the 3LI - for the Steelers.Goodnight, sweet prince. The best GIF ever will never be retired:

Jones played at DUKE. This was his whole college career!Where were u wen Dani Jones got job  
I wuz in basement eat cheezsteak wit Tony wen phon ring  
Eli is kill  
noGlad they wasted two weeks pretending Eli wasn‚Äôt washedCan't say I agree with it. The Bills were the number one defense against the pass last year. I would have let Danny Dimes sit a little bit longer and Eli would have played much better against Tampa.Poor guy getting thrown to the wolves, at least he gets to warm up before meeting the Vikings + Patriots back to backThe end of an eraWow I thought Eli would get one more shot. But I guess we'll see how he does.I only watched the game against the cowboys but Eli didn't look that bad to me. Was he much worse the second game? The team looks pretty bad either way to me but shoutout to Eli for beating the Pats in those Super Bowls.I can't wait to see the same shit Daniel has to deal with like Eli had. As if changing the QB is going to fix the nonsense the Giants given us. If I'm wrong and Daniel does well, that's great. If not, I'm going to fucking relish the on-going shitshow that is Gettleman and Shurmur.Eli's career .500 record intact üí™üèΩSteelers should trade for Eli Pronto if Rudolph doesn't look competent.Week 1: bills manage to give Darnold mono

Week 2: bills get Eli benched
